    Getting things done apps are over-complicated to-do lists, in my mind. As I
    said in a previous post, I enjoy using iCal/Mail To-dos for three reasons.
    Speed, simplicity, and I already have one of those applications open
    already. However, I was evolving and growing in my workflow. I needed to
    find a few more features in my to-do tracking. Some original ideas included
    "archiving" instead of deleting completed to-dos and a better way to
    display the information, if only in showing which is the next to-do in
    different orders. Sorting to-dos in Mail is fairly simple, and iCal is even
    worse.

  %p
    Between
    = link_to "TUAW", "http://tuaw.com"
    and
    = link_to "MacApper", "http://macapper.com/"
    I was able to select two applications to try. The first is called
    = link_to "Things", "http://www.culturedcode.com/things/"
    and is a full-blown application. Things has a fantastic user-interface, a
    great feature-set, and is under constant development. At the same time, I
    did not use all of the features the application already had. Things is
    still new software. As such, some of the polish is missing at this time
    but, it is still very usable and very beautiful. The largest negative
    point for me is that Things is an application unto itself. I already have
    plenty of windows open and I do not wish to find myself spending more time
    tracking my to-dos than actually doing them. This is a very minor issue and
    one that I will likely live with as my needs evolve further. Lastly, the
    price is a little steep at nearly $50.

  %p
    The second application is called
    = link_to "Dejumble.", "http://www.dejumble.com/"
    Unlike Things, Dejumble lives in the menubar only. Although I don’t like to
    clutter my menubar the ease of access is phenomenal and instantaneous. The
    feature set is not as complete as Things but, given my needs, that is just
    fine. The application and interface have a few flaws. First, the included
    themes are all beautiful except when the description font is impossible to
    see. Second, the search box would be extremely handy if it did something.
    When I first tried to search I typed in a word I knew was in the
    descriptions of a few to-dos and waited for a live search. Nothing happened
    so I hit enter. Unexpectedly, this created a new to-do using the form just
    below the search. Deleting this new to-do required I open iCal or Mail and,
    the delete would not remove itself in Dejumble’s list. Lastly, a to-do with
    none of the fields filled in should not be made a to-do without a warning
    message or some other notification.

  %p
    Neither of these applications scratches the itch completely but, both are
    close enough that they may warrant use. I will probably use Dejumble for
    the trial period, monitor the improvements made and then make a decision.
    I am absolutely certain that Things has or will have all that I need but, I
    don’t want to spend $50 without a need. I am thankful for Leopard because
    without its features, none of these applications would be as useful. As
    always, Mail still gets the job done.
