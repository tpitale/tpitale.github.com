    Most of my days are filled developing with Ruby in frameworks (mostly
    Rails). I use a large array of industry standard tools in doing so and my
    favorite of all, and the one most often overlooked, is the database. Of the
    databases I've worked with, researched, or been witness to,
    = link_to 'PostgreSQL', 'http://postgresql.org'
    is my database of choice. In a series of posts I'd like to cover the
    reasons I have for this love of mine, some cool things you can do with it,
    and associated links that I think you might find useful. This first part
    will cover some potential benefits one might find in using PostgreSQL in
    web application development, of all places.
  %h3 Benefits with (insert Ruby Framework here)
  %p
    Rails with ActiveRecord or Merb with DataMapper are all (with limited
    exception) designed to be database agnostic. Furthermore, they are intended
    to abstract away much of the tedium normally associated with dealing in any
    database. As a result, there is very little direct performance or feature-
    related benefit to be found by simply using PostgreSQL over say, MySQL.
  %p
    However, there exist a number of plugins and gems that enhance the features
    normally provided by our framework of choice. A few, in no particular order:
    = link_to 'sexy_pg_constraints,', 'http://github.com/maxim/sexy_pg_constraints/tree/master'
    = link_to 'acts_as_tsearch,', 'http://github.com/pka/acts_as_tsearch/tree/master'
    = link_to 'tsearchable,', 'http://github.com/dylanz/tsearchable/tree/master'
    = link_to 'rails_sql_views,', 'http://github.com/aeden/rails_sql_views/tree/master'
    and
    = link_to 'simplified_fk.', 'http://github.com/fesplugas/simplified_fk/tree/master'
  %p
    Maybe then, the benefits are performance related. Unfortunately, neither I,
    nor anyone else (so far), have reliable benchmarks on this. From everything
    I've seen, statistics are done by fans or gurus of one side or another and
    rarely does someone exist who is talented with all the databases being
    compared. Even if some such person existed, where does one set the baseline?
    All of the databases that anyone would want to use have performance tweaks
    that can be performed at a varied level of difficulty. So, who knows? In my
    opinion, whether a database is fast enough or faster than a competitor is
    entirely dependent on the situation and the needs of the problem to be
    solved.
  %h3 Features
  %ul
    %li Triggers (on both statement and row changes)
    %li Rules
    %li Constraints
    %li Partitioning
    %li Extremely advanced selects, Views
    %li Full procedural languages including: ruby, tcl, perl, python, sql
    %li Security (basic, ident, kerberos, pam, ldap, and more)
    %li Large Copy
    %li Built-in Full Text Search
    %li Extensive datatype collection, custom types
  %p
    If you don't need any of these features there are still many reasons to
    consider using PostgreSQL. Some examples: fantastic documentation for every
    production version, broad user community, stability, and in certain cases,
    performance. There's always the little things: bash completion, command
    line tools for creation/deletion of users and databases, libraries for GIS,
    every version is completely open source, performance tuning in PostgreSQL
    = link_to 'is unbelievably flexible for the situation and data in use.', 'http://www.varlena.com/GeneralBits/Tidbits/perf.html'
  %p
    Now that I've gotten all that off of my chest, I hope you are at least
    intrigued. I know I have yet to share anything of real value but, fear not,
    as I will be back soon with real examples of usage and some other more
    useful information.
