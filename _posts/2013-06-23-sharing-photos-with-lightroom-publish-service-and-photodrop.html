  In this screencast I'm going to show how I use Lightroom's Publish Service to share my photos with <a href="http://photodrop.in">PhotoDrop</a>.
</p>

  I would have normally embedded the screencast here, but Vimeo's embed has garbled the audio beyond recognition. <a href="https://vimeo.com/68958247">So, here's a link to it!</a>
</p>

<p>
  Check out the PhotoDrop shared <a href="http://photodrop.in/tpitale/favorites">Favorites folder</a> I just made.
</p>

<p>
  Create as many more published smart folders in Lightroom and they'll all be available on PhotoDrop in no time!
