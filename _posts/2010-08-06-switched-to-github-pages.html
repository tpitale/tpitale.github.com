  When I first began writing on this blog I used the excellent Webby gem
  to generate a static site from my content. I love this approach considering
  that I write so infrequently. Combined with comments by Disqus, it was (and
  still is, in some ways) the perfect solution for me.
</p>
<p>
  Counter to this was the slight pain I had in remembering how to make a new
  blog post when I did get around to writing, the rake tasks (in a webby
  wrapper command) to regenerate the whole site, and the process of deploying
  the resulting html to my own server. I was using a combination of HAML,
  HTML, Markdown, and Erb at varying degrees of complexity to mark up the site
  that would be output by Webby. I came to realize this was more than I needed.
</p>
<p>
  Github Pages and the underlying gem, Jekyll, have been available for quite
  some time now. Given the overall simplicity of the blog I had built, and that,
  ultimately, most of the content came out to be HTML in the end, I decided to
  ditch the plethora of markup I was using and make the switch to a more
  homogenous setup.
</p>
<p>
  The transition was extremely painless. I simply took most of the output from
  Webby and plopped it into the very simple structure Jekyll uses, along with my
  images, javascript, and css (all intact). I read up on the Liquid helpers
  provided and made the quick transition from the post/site syntax used by Webby
  to the quite similar syntax used by Jekyll.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, my favorite feature is simply git pushing my new content to Github.
  No self-hosting, no deploying, no hassles whatsoever. I love it! Go ahead and
  take a look <a href="http://github.com/tpitale/tpitale.github.com">at the
  repository</a>.
