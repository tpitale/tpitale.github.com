    Not much going on other than giving my talk at Rubynation in Reston. I
    think it went well for my first presentation of that size. If you were able
    to attend I would really
    = link_to "appreciate a rating", "http://speakerrate.com/talks/1168"
    on SpeakerRate. I hope everyone enjoyed it. Here are the slides for
    reference:

    I just want to say thanks to the organizers and sponsors, as well as, a
    special thanks to Russ Olsen for introducing me and kicking off the QA
    portion when my talk ran under the expected time.
