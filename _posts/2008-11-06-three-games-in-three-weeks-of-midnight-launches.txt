    The past three weeks (including tonight) have seen the launch of the three
    biggest games of 2008. Two weeks ago was the launch of Fable 2, the much
    anticipated sequel to an award winning, though short, game by the famed
    Peter Molyneux. Much of the gameplay has been tweaked, the game is much
    longer, and you have a friendly dog to aid your character. Though I am not
    done with the game, my roommate (who is on his second time through) are
    enjoying it thoroughly. Last week, Chris and I were lucky enough to attend
    the launch of Bethesda's version of Fallout, number 3. I have spent more
    time playing through Fallout 3 and, though I'm not done, I would say it is
    more than worthy of a "Best Game of the Year" title.
  %p
    Lastly, tonight, I'll be waiting for Gears of War 2! The original Gears of
    War was very probably my favorite game a short while ago. Aside from Halo 3
    it was the primary reason that I purchased an Xbox 360 while in college. It
    has won many, many awards in the past, and I expect it will win many, many
    more in its second iteration.
  %p
    I hope, for the first time in my life, I can play through all of these
    games to something that could be considered completion, if not to complete
    all of the various achievements. If only there were more hours in the day!
