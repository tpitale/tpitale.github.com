  Not much going on other than giving my talk at Rubynation in Reston. I
  think it went well for my first presentation of that size. If you were able
  to attend I would really <a href="http://speakerrate.com/talks/1168">appreciate a rating</a>
  on SpeakerRate. I hope everyone enjoyed it. Here are the slides for reference:

  I just want to say thanks to the organizers and sponsors, as well as, a
  special thanks to Russ Olsen for introducing me and kicking off the QA
  portion when my talk ran under the expected time.
