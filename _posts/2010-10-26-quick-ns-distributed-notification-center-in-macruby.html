  I've started working on MacRuby project, that I'll talk more about later,
  but I had some fun getting notifications from iTunes about track changes
  and play/pause events. I found the documentation for NSDistributedNotificationCenter
  and was able to whip up this quick example in MacRuby.

  First, you have to install and use MacRuby. The fastest way to do this is
  with the fantastic <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">RVM</a>. Simply do
  <code>rvm install macruby &amp;&amp; rvm use macruby</code>. After that
  you can use the following gist and watch it spit out any and all distributed
  notifications. Try opening iTunes and switching tracks to see some interesting
  information.

  I hope this quick example is useful and I hope to post more about my MacRuby
  experience, soon. Stay tuned to see what I'm building!
