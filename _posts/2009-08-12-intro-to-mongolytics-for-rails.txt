    Last time, I wrote about how I was messing around with MongoDB (
    = link_to_page 'MongoDB in a Deployed Environment'
    ) and how I had gotten it in a deployed state. However, I failed to cover
    my reasons for doing so. Why would I need to deploy MongoDB if I was only
    "messing around"?
  %p
    The answer is my latest Ruby library: Mongolytics. As you can probably
    surmise, the name is a combination of MongoDB and analytics. You would be
    correct in guessing so. The interesting thing about Mongolytics, aside from
    its use of MongoDB is that the analytics are tracked on the server side of
    the request/response cycle.
  %p
    Google has been (and will continue to be) the leader in the web analytics
    domain. And as everyone who has worked with Google Analytics knows, the
    tracking is done via Javascripts on the client side. This is the best way
    to operate given the scale of the operation and the data that GA collects.
  %p
    I needed something to track not only page requests, but actions in Rails
    which may or may not have associated unique URIs. An example of this would
    be a create action. Typically, in a resourceful controller and in REST
    principles, a successful create should redirect to the newly created
    resource. This is most likely a show action.
  %p
    In order to track this sort of thing, I could have added some fancy
    Javascript to make a pageview of every submit button click or any number
    of other fancy solutions.
  %p
    This solution provides a few benefits. Speed, first and foremost. The
    results of any request instantly present a query-able statistic. This leads
    to the second benefit. The entire history of our statistics are permanently
    and easily accessible through a MongoMapped class.
  %h3 Using Mongolytics
  %p
    There are three main parts to using Mongolytics (aside from
    = link_to "setting up MongoMapper", "http://railstips.org/2009/7/23/getting-started-with-mongomapper-and-rails"
    ): include the module, tell it what actions you want to track, and when
    some stats have been tracked we can turn around and retrieve them. Here is
    what that might look like:
  %h3 Include the Module
  %a.gist{:href => 'http://gist.github.com/166751'}
  %h3 Track Actions
  %a.gist{:href => 'http://gist.github.com/166753'}
  %h3 Check the Stats
  %a.gist{:href => 'http://gist.github.com/166755'}
  %p
    And that is it. MongoDB will store all that stuff and make it easy to pull
    back out again. I tried to make it as quick and painless as possible. There
    are more options, including tracking session variables, that I will get
    to in another post (with a real example). In the meantime, please check out
