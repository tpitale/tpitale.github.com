    is the best tool available on the web (especially for Ruby developers) to
    manage the content on a website. When I say website I mean a general class
    of website that has no dynamic content. Websites such as personal blogs are
    ideal candidates for Webby as they only change when a new post is made.
    Webby is essentially the lightest, most hackable CMS available.
  <p>
    In my case, I needed a tool to create a website that was not database-
    backed but, the content changed frequently enough to warrant a simple means
    by which I could update and makes other changes. Having been working with
    Ruby and the Rails/Merb frameworks, I wished I could have the rendering
    abilities and helper methods of these frameworks. However, both require
    massive resources in comparison to serving up static files. Therefore, both
    were overkill with all of their abilities designed for web applications.
  <p>
    In this ongoing series of posts I will do my best to cover Webby and some
    of the features of Webby that are not fully covered in the tutorials. Also,
    I would really love to help out anyone interested in Webby that is not sure
    that Webby will meet their needs (and don't have time to dig into Webby
    itself to find out).

    Check back tomorrow for my next post in the series on some of the essential
    features that I found in Webby, but not in the documentation.
