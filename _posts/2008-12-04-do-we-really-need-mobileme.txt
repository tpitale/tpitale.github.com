    MobileMe is a pretty awesome service. However, having used it for at least
    six months, I'm pretty well decided that it is not quite worth $100 a year.
    In addition, Google has just released, officially, it's support for CalDAV
    syncing between iCal and Google Calendar. Google's support of IMAP has also
    grown strong over this time period. Last, the final important piece of the
    puzzle is
    = link_to "Dropbox", "http://www.getdropbox.com"
    , which is now open for public beta and works very well.

    Setting up IMAP with google is simple and you can find directions
    = link_to "here.", "http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=75725"
  %p
    Setting up Google's iCal support is almost as easy, especially with their
    set-up tool. Directions can be found
    = link_to "here.", "http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=99358#ical"
  %p
    The benefits of these combined services speak for themselves, but in any
    case, I'll repeat them here. Dropbox serves to replace the need for iDisk
    sharing since it works by synchronizing all of the files within given
    directories between all of your computers. Dropbox is not only useable on
    Mac OS X and Windows, it now works on Linux (Ubuntu only). CalDAV is also
    completely cross-platform using a product from Mozilla,
    = link_to "Sunbird.", "http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/"
    Of course, given my love of OS X, CalDAV works extremely well within iCal
    on Leopard. Finally, email, being the most important of all, works on any
    email client that supports IMAP (almost every client). Not only this but,
    it magically syncs between all computers and my iPhone.
  %p
    There are a few remaining features that I don't consider to be critical to
    the service because I don't use them or because there are other services
    that have existed for some time to handle the feature. Photo sharing, for
    example, is more than capably covered by Flickr. The greatest drawback, in
    my opinion, of this piecemeal approach is the lack of a unified website for
    when you are away from your computer. All-in-all, the MobileMe website is
    not worth the  money and neither is MobileMe now, thanks to Google and
    Dropbox.
