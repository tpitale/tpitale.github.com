    Just a quick post tonight. It is appropriate to give access to Apache, or
    Nginx, to the www-data user that has sites or applications deployed under
    their care. It is also appropriate limit www-data's access to the system as
    much as possible. The appropriate method by which to give access then is to
    add them to the sudoers file. Often, you may see the sudoers file used to
    permit a super user, of sorts, access to all of the system as a temporary
    root user. However, sudo is extremely powerful. Here is how you would give
    the www-data user access to only restart an Nginx server using the init
    scripts.
  %pre
    %code
      \# Make a command alias
      Cmnd_Alias NGINX=/etc/init.d/nginx
  %pre
    %code
      \# Give access, removing password requirement is optional
      www-data ALL=NOPASSWD: NGINX
  %p
    And there we have it. Simply drop the NOPASSWD: section to require a
    password be used. Now, deployment utilities, like Capistrano can be setup
    to start, stop, and restart Nginx as the configuration changes. A very
    simple example to start Nginx with capistrano would be:
  %pre
    %code
      desc "Start Nginx"
      task :start, :roles => :web do
      &#09;run "/etc/init.d/nginx start"
      end
  %p
    All in all, a good skill to have. I know I'll be re-reading the MAN pages
    for sudo in the coming days because there is much more sys-admin power to
    be found.
