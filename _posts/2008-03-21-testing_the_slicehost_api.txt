  %p
    I was fortunate enough to join slicehost this past week. It is a fantastic
    service, possibly the best VPS I've encountered. While perusing their forum
    as I am want to do from time to time, I noticed a new post by a slicehost
    employee requesting beta-testers (a favorite phrase of mine) for their new
    API. I've used ActiveResource in the past and I thought it would be worth a
    shot.
  %p
    I threw in my hat on the forum and was summarily rewarded with an email
    from a slicehost employee. I was given an API key and some documentation
    with examples in Ruby and Python. Given my ActiveResource experience I
    immediately went to work with their example. It was a breeze and one that
    I am delighted to say any Rubyist would be able to complete.
  %p
    I completed the example, messed around a bit more, and then I retired for
    the evening. The next day I received a short questionnaire which I
    dutifully filled out and returned. My tinkering was not over, however. Oh,
    no. The next free chance I had, I dove right in. Given the access the beta
    provided I could create only two things off the top of my head. The first,
    a dynamic-dns-type updater. The second, a monitor of system status.
  %p
    So far, I have only completed the dynamic dns updater. It is crude but, it
    provides the basic functionality required. It allows you to provide a 
    Zone and a Record, as well as, the IP address to use when updating the
    record. If you do not provide an IP address, the current external IP of
    your location will be used.
  %p
    The point of all this is I can have a domain name pointing to my home IP.
    If my provider changes my IP for whatever reason, the script, run by cron
    on a regular basis will tell slicehost, my DNS provider, that my home IP
    address has changed within a reasonable amount of time.
