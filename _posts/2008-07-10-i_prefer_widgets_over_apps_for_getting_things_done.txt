    I posted awhile back about my attempts at using
    = link_to("Things", "http://www.culturedcode.com/things/")
    for my GTD needs. While Cultured Code has made an amazing application,
    even in beta, I was finding myself with features I didn't want and missing
    some features I did want.
  %p
    As such, I've learned to make due using a fine combination of iCal and Mail
    for to do lists. Now, with the addition of something 
    = link_to("new from the fine developers at iSlayer", "http://www.islayer.com/index.php?op=item&id=64")
    I have a wonderful little widget that lets me integrate perfectly into
    this system I've got going. Organized is the name of the new widget and I
    think it fits precisely. Now, I don't have to leave Mail or iCal running
    for all the times that I'm on my Mac (which is a lot).
  %p
    Organized is beautifully crafted, as all iSlayer widgets and products that
    I have encountered. As you can see from the screenshots on the web page
    Organized is dominated by the calendar at the top, which is just how I like
    it. Beneath are four tabs: clocks, notes, events, and to dos. I do not
    often use the notes and I have yet to have a real use for clocks. However,
    having events present (with which you can see events in the coming days)
    has been extremely useful for getting my head around an ever more populous
    calendar.
  %p
    The last tab, to dos, is the tab I use most. Mostly because it adds such a
    simple, quick, and perfectly powerful list. While at the same time, those
    to dos work their way back into the rest of my system, for when I do have
    Mail or iCal open, I like to have access to those to dos. I've learned to
    organize my buckets as calendars that accurately represent my life. Around
    these calendars I create groups that mimic the major focuses, life and
    work. Perfect!
