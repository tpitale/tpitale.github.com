Like many of you I took the new year as time to reflect. This year especially because January marked my 30th birthday.

With refreshed goals in mind I set out to create the systems, and hopefully, habits that will help me to live â€¦

The best way that I've found to grow is through deliberate practice. Review and feedback are critical components. What follows is my review for January 2024.

### Coding ###

I started the year by contributing to open source projects. Mostly my own. I made at least one contribution a day. I have been extremely successful in this. I'll soon be writing a post on the benefits I've found, how I managed to keep it up for even one month, and the challenges I faced.

### Writing ###

GrowingDevs
My own writing

Whittling down the many posts in my Evernote.

My ideas for a book also continue to evolve, but that is not yet an active goal. The system is little work at a time.

### Helping Others ###

I haven't done as much with this. But I believe I've developed some ideas for a system that I want.

1. Reached out to code now
2. Offer to help with OSS projects
3. Publicize my availability as a mentor/speaking coach

### Photography ###

Did not do a photo walk in January. But I did a "product" photo shoot. Practice for my off-camera flash technique.

### Finish What I Start ###

Finished a project before January started. My OSS have also been brought back into a state of repair after my month of coding.

### Monthly Reviews ###

Here you have it. Check.

### Changes to the Systems ###

Biweekly reviews. Close feedback and introspection is important. Monthly is too long. They will also be shorter.

Less coding. Average above 1 OSS per day.

Want to read, and meditate more. Look for that in my next recap.

These reviews are good. But, I fully intend to cut down on some of these. Learning to drive a motorcycle may already be cut from the agenda.
