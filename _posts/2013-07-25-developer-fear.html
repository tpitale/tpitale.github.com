  I loved Adam's post, <a href="http://therealadam.com/2013/07/24/i-dont-have-time-to-not-teach/">
  I don't have time to not teach</a>. It's the perfect length. It's straight to
  the point. And, I've had a very similar experience.
</p>
<h3>I Don't Have Time to be Afraid to Teach</h3>
<p>
  Inspired by this, I wanted to share a thought, or sentiment, that I've had over the years:
  don't be afraid. Don't be afraid to teach, to share, or to guide. Someone, anyone.
</p>
<p>
  One of a developer's greatest fears is to be seen as ignorant. But, for a long time,
  I was very afraid to share something I had learned, thinking that <i>surely</i>
  everyone else knew about it, and I would be found out for my ignorance.
</p>
<p>
  As it turns out, there is always someone learning. Always someone who knows less
  than you do. So teach, share, and guide others. Do it through writing, speaking,
  or best of all: pairing with those nearest you.
