<p>
	I was working on a project for a client and I hit a wall with "search". Thus far, I'd been making due with PostgreSQL. This was fine as the tool was only used by a small set of users, internally. This made PostgreSQL "search" the pragmatic choice. Unfortunately, with just one keyword, it becomes increasingly nasty to search many fields. Especially, and this is key, when joining tables. Thankfully, I had read about Sunspot
