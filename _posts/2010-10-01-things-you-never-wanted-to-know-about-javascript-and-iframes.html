<h3>Sizing and Resizing</h3>
<p>
  If an iframe is in a window that is smaller than its needs for minimum height
  and width, and you haven't done anything to suppress them, you'll get scrollbars.
  The interesting thing is when we use a little bit of JavaScript to get the sizing:
</p>
<p>
  <a class="gist" href="http://gist.github.com/607216">iframe sizing javascript</a>
</p>
<p>
  In this example we'll just assume that <code>iframe</code> is the iframe element
  we want to be operating on.
</p>
<p>
  What's interesting about the above example is that despite the parent window
  being a smaller size than the required area of the iframe, the sizing values
  we'll get back will be the actual height and width of that the contained page
  requires. So, if you're using something like a 960px grid then it is very
  likely that the value will be '960px'.
</p>
<p>
  Even more interesting is what will happen if we increase the window to be
  large enough to properly display the entire iframe and its contents. If we
  were to run that JavaScript again, the values returned will be the sizing
  of the parent as well not simply the minimum required space for the iframe.
</p>
<p>
  While interesting, this information is really very useful if you're trying to
  match the size of other elements on a page, or do some resizing. In my case I
  was on a quest to match the size of an iframe with a canvas element in order
  to add an overlay.
</p>
<h3>Events of the 'scroll' Variety</h3>
<p>
  If we want to add an event listener (in many, but not all, browsers) we would
  normally attach it to <code>window</code> but what if we have an iframe? In this
  case we can use the previously mentioned <code>contentWindow</code> like so:
</p>
<p>
  <a class="gist" href="http://gist.github.com/607221">iframe sizing javascript</a>
