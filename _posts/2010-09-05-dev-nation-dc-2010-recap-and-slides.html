  Last weekend I had the privilege of speaking at DevNation in DC held at
  Viget's own offices in Falls Church. I was among the ranks of some of the
  finest presenters in a community of passionate developers including Aaron
  Bedra of Relevance, Dave Troy, and one of Viget's senior front-end developers:
  Blake Walters. Here are my slides from my presentation on Tonality and Timbre:
  Lessons for Personal Improvement from Musical Instruction.

  My original intention with this talk was to seek inspiration in my years of
  musical study (I play trombone) and to draw parallels to the software development
  universe. By doing so, I had hoped to uncover some new and innovative ways by
  which we all might seek to improve our skills. However, I found that there
  already existed a significant number of practices. Most of all, we must be
  reminded to keep up with the basics, seek feedback, and always be cognizant of
  our own growth. I hope future iterations of this talk will allow me to expand on
  some of these ideas.

  If you were present at DevNation and at my talk, I would sincerely appreciate

  In addition, I really enjoyed my comrade Blake's presentation on the Garber-Irish
  Implementation for management of architected javascript. You can see his
