    %h3 The basic steps are as follows:
    %ol
      %li Order Verizon Fios
      %li
        During installation have the installer turn on the ethernet port in the
        MOCA, not the coax
      %li Have the installer leave you with a "NIM"
      %li Setup your router as you would have with any other ISP
      %li Connect the "NIM" to your router
      %li Connect the "NIM" to a coax port in your house
      %li
        Have the installer connect and activate your television set-top-boxes
        (STB)
  
  %h3 Now for some explanation  
  <p>
    I think ordering should be pretty self-explanatory. However, I have not
    said anything about why a sane person would wish to do this instead of
    letting the nice Verizon installer do their job. It's all in the hardware
    Using the Actiontec router Verizon provides is fine, if you've never had a
    wireless home network before. For the rest of us, being allowed to use our
    own, existing, setup is not possible without the foreknowledge or the will
    to fight for the information.

  %h3 Onto the more technical stuff
  <p>
    The MOCA is the box that is left outside of your house. Essentially, it
    receives and interprets the signal. It takes the place of what we once
    called a MODEM. In this box, there are multiple connections, one of which
    is the standard ethernet port any Linksys, DLink, or Apple router knows and
    loves. There is also a port that passes the network information over a coax
    (short for coaxial) cable. This is the port left on by Verizon normally
    because the Actiontec router (which, with a simple google search, one will
    find is nearly worthless) is intended to work with it. Using the ethernet
    port is required so that every other brand of standard router will operate.
  <p>
    Next, we set up our router in much the same way it would be set up with a
    DSL or Cable ISP. Verizon uses the standard, DHCP, to give your router an
    IP address. At this point, assuming the internet has been activated by the
    installer, you should be able to get on the internet at the wonderfully
    blazing speeds that Fios provides.
  <p>
    The last major step is asking the installer to give you a "NIM". I never
    found out what "NIM" stood for, but it's purpose is clear. In order to
    get access to the programming guide or to video-on-demand services your
    STBs must have internet access, too. The "NIM" should have two ports. The
    first is an ethernet port and the second is a coax connector. Can you guess
    what to do? Plug an ethernet cable from your router into the "NIM" and plug
    a coax cable into the other port. The final coax connection should be made
    to any coax cable outlet in your home as they are all inter-connected. The
    "NIM" acts as translator in place of the Actiontec router and provides
    internet access for the STBs to use. The STBs do have ethernet ports (at
    least the latest Motorola box Verizon provided) but internet access does
    not appear to be the purpose, but rather, home network connection for
    certain media-sharing capabilities (music, movies, pictures to the TV).
  <p>
    At this point, the installer should be able to simply plug in all of your
    STBs and activate them as needed through Verizon.

    Disclaimer: I am not a Verizon technician. If for some strange reason any
    of these instructions mess up your system I take no responsibility as
    these are only the methods that worked FOR ME. Your Mileage May Vary!
