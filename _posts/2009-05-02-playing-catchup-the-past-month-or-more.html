  I've been busy. At work, at home (working), and always in my head. I can't
  decide which is more exciting: the news that I'll be speaking, along with
  three of my Viget comrades at RubyNation this year, or that Google
  Analytics finally made their data export API public so that I might release
  my new gem, Garb. I developed Garb at Viget and it is to Viget that I owe
  everything in this opportunity. Without the marketing folks I would not
  have had access to the beta API, and without Viget in general it would not
  have happened.
</p>
<p>
  Let's start with RubyNation. My talk will be on DataMapper and Rails and
  you can find out more <a href="http://www.rubynation.org/">on the RubyNation website.</a>
  From the website (my proposal):
  <blockquote>
    DataMapper has pushed the Ruby ORM market to new heights of speed (through
    laziness), strength (through separation), and flexibility (through mapping).
    At this time the rails_datamapper plugin is the way to bring DM and Rails
    together. Soon, the Merb/Rails merger will lead to seamless inter-operability
    between DM and Rails. ...
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    We’ll begin by covering the basics of setting up DM in Rails. We’ll quickly
    move on to cover, at the very least, overriding keys of varying types, non-
    standard table naming, connecting to multiple databases for the purpose of
    syncing or migrating data, and a variety of association examples.
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Next, onto Garb. Google released a data export API for all of the Google
  Analytics date they have. It provides an unprecedented level of access to
  data never-before available. To make the API easy and fun when working
  with Ruby I, with the help of folks at Viget, created a handy wrapper with
  which anyone can create custom reports in their Ruby application. I've
  reached near to feature-parity with the API itself and aside from OAuth
  you can do almost anything you would need.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://github.com/vigetlabs/garb">Check it out on Github.</a>
</p>
<p>
  What else? I'm very excited to be working on an unreleased Rails project
  with an unannounced, famed designer. What I can tell you is that it is
  presently named (codenamed?) Tasty and I'm hoping to have it out "soon". Oh,
  and it will be able to do some stuff that nobody in its market will be
  able to do.
<p>
  I hope you'll check out
  <a href="http://github.com/vigetlabs/garb">Garb</a>
  and I hope you'll come hear my talk at
  <a href="http://www.rubynation.org">RubyNation.</a>
  See you there!
