    Express. Express is a clone of the software and configuration
    used in an Engine Yard Slice. This is another amazing development. Engine
    Yard customers can now have a development or staging environment on their
    own machines that mirrors their production environment. Everyone else can
    simply see how powerful Engine Yard's stack of software really is. You can
