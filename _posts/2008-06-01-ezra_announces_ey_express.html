    Along with Vertebra, which isn't available for use just yet, Ezra announced
    <a href="http://www.engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a>
    Express. Express is a clone of the software and configuration
    used in an Engine Yard Slice. This is another amazing development. Engine
    Yard customers can now have a development or staging environment on their
    own machines that mirrors their production environment. Everyone else can
    simply see how powerful Engine Yard's stack of software really is. You can
    download
    <a href="http://express.engineyard.com/system/ey_express_v0.1.tar.bz2">Engine Yard Express</a>
    , right now. Warning: the image is 343MB.
