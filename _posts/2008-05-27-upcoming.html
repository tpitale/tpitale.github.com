    The short story is: 
    <a href="http://www.viget.com">Viget</a>
    is being extremely generous and is paying for me to travel to
    <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home">RailsConf</a>
    this year. Despite the fact that I have only been in their employ for three
    whole weeks. I'm extremely happy working there and I only hope that I am
    living up to their expectations of me.
  <p>
    I am excited to go to RailsConf for two reasons. First, I have never been
    to a conference before, any conference, and I really expect to learn a lot
    in the sessions I am enrolled in. Second, I may finally get to meet many of
    the people I talk to on the irc chat rooms for Merb and DataMapper. People
    like Yehuda Katz, Ezra Z., Adam French (who I think is going), and a
    coworker from Viget South, Ben Scofield, who will be speaking, as well. All
    in all I have extremely high hopes for this trip.
  <p>
    In other news, I've got draft copies of many, many blog posts. The problem
    is trying to decide where they will be appropriate. Some are about the beta
    for
    <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
    (my favorite service, at the moment), including some nifty tricks. Another
    post is a followup to Getting Things Done with Mail and iCal combined with
    a review of the GTD application, Things. On the
    <a href="http://www.viget.com/extend/">Viget Extend blog</a>
    , I've got some ideas for posts on topics ranging from Microsoft Exchange
    calendar subscriptions in iCal to accessing the LDAP global address list
    from Address Book.
