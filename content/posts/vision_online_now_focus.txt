    I have spent my free time, nights and weekends, working to create a new
    version of Vision, online. For those that do not know, Vision is the
    peerless, just-in-time, inventory control and point of sale system for the
    retail liquor market.
  %p
    The project was originally titled Vision Online. That name is simple and
    it works with all of the branding that
    = link_to "ICS", "http://www.ics-nj.com"
    has already done. However, this product heads out on its own and addresses
    a slightly new market. As such, a new name was a must.
  %p
    Thanks to a stroke of genius by my associate Chris, we've switched to the
    name Focus. The name is brilliant for three, important, reasons. First,
    the original product is named Vision and Focus is just that, a focusing of
    the features and benefits of using Vision. Second, the use of this
    product is intended to focus the users' inventory until it is as close as
    possible to just-in-time. Lastly, a function of a person's literal vision
    is the ability to focus. We are hoping that this reincarnation of Vision
    will enable a user to focus on getting their inventory in line and online.
  %p
    Solidifying this branding was important for me, as a developer, because it
    provides a northern star, a guiding light, to my goal. The meaning that
    branding holds for a user is realized many times over, for me. It is an
    important aspect of development, keeping the goals, ideals, and vision of
    the product, in mind.
