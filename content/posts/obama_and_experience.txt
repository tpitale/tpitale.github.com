    I won't often speak of politics. In fact, I would like this to be my one
    and only post on the subject.
    %b
      I am a Barack Obama supporter.
    The man says a lot of things, just as every other candidate has. However,
    as I've learned, few can back it up. Yes, John McCain was a POW. That is
    horrible but, has no bearing on his ability to be president. His health
    should be of much greater concern. As for Hillary, she talks a whole lot.
    A significant amount of hatred spews from her mouth. On top of that, many
    claims that she makes are only true in the simplest sense. For example, she
    speaks of how she has introduced legislation to improve healthcare and the
    related industry and regulations. What she doesn't say is that very little
    of her legislation passes or is even supported by her peers. Many of these
    bills introduced speak very vaguely about "improving healthcare at sometime
    in the future", without ever mentioning how or when.
  %p
    Something I have learned working in the IT/Software industry, in a very
    short time, is that time does NOT equal experience. I know many a developer
    that has worked for 20 years and has little more real experience than
    another particular developer, one who had only been in the corporate world
    for 2, maybe 3, years. It is the passion that drives us all. This passion
    leads a person to find the experience because it is something they want.
    For many, it is something that simply may or may not happen over time.
  %p
    If you want to understand just how passionate Barack Obama is, look at how
    passionate his followers are. Barack Obama's passion drives others to be
    just as passionate. This could also be seen in another characteristic of
    Bill Clinton. As Chris Rock used to say in a show, "Bill Clinton is so
    famous, someone else got famous just from sucking his dick!"
  %p
    Granted, passion isn't everything but, it drives a person to seek out the
    many other characteristics that make an exceptional person. The traits and
    abilities that a person must possess to be the president. Barack Obama has
    these traits and abilities. He may not have been a POW but, he has the
    necessary abilities at the most basic level to achieve anything he wants.
    In addition, we must face the fact that nothing will ever prepare a person
    truly for being one of the most powerful people in the world. So, we must
    look to the building blocks.
  %p
    Another excellent measure of a person's character and merit is in the way
    they communicate to the public. Barack Obama, and his campaign, do not
    speak hatefully of any other person. Even when it is well deserved, honest
    and would sometimes be necessary. This type of level-headed behavior is
    precisely what the country needs, right now. Excitable behavior, lack of
    quality information has gotten this country in way over its head in war,
    death, debt, and built as a reputation that contrives an extreme level of
    hatred from nearly every other country in the world.
  %p
    These are only a few of the multitude of "things" that are required to be
    the president. No one person can ever speak of every quality necessary. My
    only fear at this point is that something, someone, is going to screw it up
    for the rest of the country.
