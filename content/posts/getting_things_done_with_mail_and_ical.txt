    I'm new to the practice of getting things done (GTD). I am aware of most
    of the principles and I am aware of the plethora of GTD software for Mac
    OS X. A number of weeks ago I took a brief survey of the available software
    in this particular field and, being a newcomer to the actual practice I
    felt sufficiently overwhelmed by the features of each. I do realize that
    GTD is about more than just a todo list but, for the ultra efficient all of
    these applications seemed to take more time to get set up, and to use than
    a simple checklist. Priorities are nice, as are due-dates but, beyond that
    I thought I would be better off with a simpler solution.
  %p
    So far, I am right. The metaphorical ticket, for me, was being constantly
    (or nearly constantly) aware of my list. Knowing this, and knowing that I
    live much of my life on my Mac I found the simplest solution I could
    manage: Mail and iCal. These two applications together provide the
    essentials that are required of a todo list. First, they make it easy to
    monitor your list. Second, they make it easy to access your list from two
    frequently accessed applications. Third, they make it exceptionally easy
    to add new items to my list.

    I've gotten in the habit of adding every little thing I could possibly
    accomplish in a day. I get to as much as I can. This accomplishes a couple
    goals. I get a big list of things to choose from and choice is always nice.
    It also provides that constant reminder for even the little things, many of
    which I would likely forget (or ignore) during the day.
  %p
    Perhaps someday I will switch to some uber-GTD software but, for now, my
    requirements have been satisfied. I would recommend this process to anyone
    who is considering tackling the daunting GTD world.
