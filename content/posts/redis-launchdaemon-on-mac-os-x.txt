    LaunchDaemons are the Mac OS X equivalent of init.d scripts on most Linux systems.
    I keep mine collected in the root LaunchDaemons folder at /Library/LaunchDaemons.
    LaunchDaemons are simply xml plist configuration files which indicate the how, where,
    and when to start a server which daemonizes at startup. Here's one for Redis:

  %p
    %h3 Redis LaunchDaemon
    %a.gist{:href => "http://gist.github.com/264721"}

  %p
    The important lines to note are 9 and 10, under ProgramArguments. The first line is
    where I built the Redis server and placed it on my system. Yours may be in a different
    location entirely. The second is the configuration I use. If you are using the default
    you can probably skip that line.

  %p
    In either case, you should change the working directory to the path in which you have
    Redis built so that the default configuration is used, relative to the server command.    

  %p
    Overall, the LaunchDaemon is simple despite being foreign to most of us used to creating
    init.d scripts. I'll have one up for MongoDB shortly.
