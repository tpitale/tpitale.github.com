                I have spent my free time, nights and weekends, working to create a new
                version of Vision, online. For those that do not know Vision is the
                peerless just-in-time, inventory control, and point of sale system for the
                retail liquor market.
=======
                Some people like to come home and "dock" their laptops to a desktop-type
                setup. There is no such thing for a Mac, not in the way that the Dell users
                of the world might imagine it. However, there are two ways to accomplish
                the same features. The first involves another Mac, the second does not.
=======
                In my previous post I discussed my eventual discovery that
                <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>
                would not work for a new project I had begun. Thankfully, I was at the very
                beginning of my work on said project and making a transition to a new path
                was not the end of the world.

                The project was originally titled Vision Online. That name is simple and
                it works with all of the branding that ICS has already done. However, this
                product heads out on its own and addresses a slightly new market. As such,
                a new name was a must.
=======
                The first, and conceptually more complicated method relies upon two
                features that Macs have had as long as I can remember using them. Upon
                booting, a Mac (laptop or desktop) can act as an external hard drive case
                for the drive inside. Simply holding down T will start this mode. Now, we
                can plug this Mac into another and use this hard drive as the boot drive.
                Simply hold down the Option key when booting the "base", desktop Mac. The
                desktop will boot the hard drive in the laptop. If you have an Intel Mac,
                the computers can be connected with a USB cable or a Firewire cable. If you
                are using a PowerPC Mac, a Firewire cable must be used.
=======
                As I mentioned, a helpful suggestion led me to investigate
                <a href="http://merbivore.com">Merb</a>
                as a potential framework. Merb has the benefit of letting me use any of
                three possible database ORMs. ActiveRecord is supported, as well as,
                <a href="http://datamapper.org/">DataMapper</a>
                and Sequel. Obviously, ActiveRecord did not work for me and so, I looked at
                both DataMapper and Sequel. I found DataMapper to be more usable out of the
                box and so I moved ahead using it. Sequel would have been another excellent
                alternative but, I had to pick one and continue with my work.

                Thanks to a stroke of genius by my associate Chris, we've switched to the
                name Focus. The name is brilliant for three, important, reasons. First,
                the original product is named Vision and Focus is just that, a focusing of
                the features and benefits of using Vision. Second, the use of such a
                product is intended to focus the users inventory until it is as close as
                possible to just-in-time. Lastly, a function of Vision is the ability to
                Focus.
=======
                The second method is far more simplistic. Apple (and many other companies)
                offer bluetooth keyboards and mice. Simply plug in an external monitor and
                use the bluetooth built into most Macs for the keyboard and mouse. With one
                physical cable you have essentially the same setup as all those "dock"
                users.
=======
                How did DataMapper solve my legacy database issues, you may ask. The answer
                is that DataMapper provides all the same standard solutions that
                ActiveRecord does but, it allows for keys to be text or any other type as
                long as they are unique and not null. The sql requirements for a primary
                key state that it must be unique and not null, there is no requirement for
                type. There was one little issue with DataMapper in which the text fields
                were being ignored because, in DataMapper, text fields are lazy. These
                fields will not be loaded until they are requested by an application. This
                led to a number of issues but, because DataMapper is so very easy to
                contribute to, I was able to make the necessary changes with much
                appreciation from the community.

              <p>
                In terms of conventions, DataMapper has another nifty trick up its sleeve.
                In DataMapper, when defining a column, you may use a different name for the
                property and later define the actual column name from the database. I was
                extremely enthused to find that I could change names from the database from
                <code>wc_shlfprce</code>
                to something like:
                <code>warm_case_shelf_price.</code>
                Though it was a longer name, in terms of legibility the latter is an
                infinite improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                And so, I work on, with Merb and DataMapper as my preferred tools, at least
                for this particular project. Aside from this flexibility, DataMapper would
                normally adhere to the same specific conventions for a database as does
                ActiveRecord. Any new converts from Rails will likely feel right at home.
