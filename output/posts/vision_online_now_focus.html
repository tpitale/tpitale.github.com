            <h1>Vision Online, Now Focus</h1>
            <h2>The exciting tale of a Merb Application and branding</h2>
            <span class='date'>2008-03-11</span>
            <p>
              I have spent my free time, nights and weekends, working to create a new
              version of Vision, online. For those that do not know, Vision is the
              peerless, just-in-time, inventory control and point of sale system for the
              retail liquor market.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project was originally titled Vision Online. That name is simple and
              it works with all of the branding that
              <a href="http://www.ics-nj.com">ICS</a>
              has already done. However, this product heads out on its own and addresses
              a slightly new market. As such, a new name was a must.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks to a stroke of genius by my associate Chris, we've switched to the
              name Focus. The name is brilliant for three, important, reasons. First,
              the original product is named Vision and Focus is just that, a focusing of
              the features and benefits of using Vision. Second, the use of this
              product is intended to focus the users' inventory until it is as close as
              possible to just-in-time. Lastly, a function of a person's literal vision
              is the ability to focus. We are hoping that this reincarnation of Vision
              will enable a user to focus on getting their inventory in line and online.
            </p>
            <p>
              Solidifying this branding was important for me, as a developer, because it
              provides a northern star, a guiding light, to my goal. The meaning that
              branding holds for a user is realized many times over, for me. It is an
              important aspect of development, keeping the goals, ideals, and vision of
              the product, in mind.
