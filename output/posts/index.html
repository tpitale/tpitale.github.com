              <h1>PostgreSQL Part 1</h1>
              <h2>Benefits for Web Application Development</h2>
              <span class='date'>2009-01-26</span>
              <p>
                Most of my days are filled developing with Ruby in frameworks (mostly
                Rails). I use a large array of industry standard tools in doing so and my
                favorite of all, and the one most often overlooked, is the database. Of the
                databases I've worked with, researched, or been witness to,
                <a href="http://postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>
                is my database of choice. In a series of posts I'd like to cover the
                reasons I have for this love of mine, some cool things you can do with it,
                and associated links that I think you might find useful. This first part
                will cover some potential benefits one might find in using PostgreSQL in
                web application development, of all places.
              </p>
              <h3>Benefits with (insert Ruby Framework here)</h3>
              <p>
                Rails with ActiveRecord or Merb with DataMapper are all (with limited
                exception) designed to be database agnostic. Furthermore, they are intended
                to abstract away much of the tedium normally associated with dealing in any
                database. As a result, there is very little direct performance or feature-
                related benefit to be found by simply using PostgreSQL over say, MySQL.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, there exist a number of plugins and gems that enhance the features
                normally provided by our framework of choice. A few, in no particular order:
                <a href="http://github.com/maxim/sexy_pg_constraints/tree/master">sexy_pg_constraints,</a>
                <a href="http://github.com/pka/acts_as_tsearch/tree/master">acts_as_tsearch,</a>
                <a href="http://github.com/dylanz/tsearchable/tree/master">tsearchable,</a>
                <a href="http://github.com/aeden/rails_sql_views/tree/master">rails_sql_views,</a>
                and
                <a href="http://github.com/fesplugas/simplified_fk/tree/master">simplified_fk.</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Maybe then, the benefits are performance related. Unfortunately, neither I,
                nor anyone else (so far), have reliable benchmarks on this. From everything
                I've seen, statistics are done by fans or gurus of one side or another and
                rarely does someone exist who is talented with all the databases being
                compared. Even if some such person existed, where does one set the baseline?
                All of the databases that anyone would want to use have performance tweaks
                that can be performed at a varied level of difficulty. So, who knows? In my
                opinion, whether a database is fast enough or faster than a competitor is
                entirely dependent on the situation and the needs of the problem to be
                solved.
              </p>
              <h3>Features</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Triggers (on both statement and row changes)</li>
                <li>Rules</li>
                <li>Constraints</li>
                <li>Partitioning</li>
                <li>Extremely advanced selects, Views</li>
                <li>Full procedural languages including: ruby, tcl, perl, python, sql</li>
                <li>Security (basic, ident, kerberos, pam, ldap, and more)</li>
                <li>Large Copy</li>
                <li>Built-in Full Text Search</li>
                <li>Extensive datatype collection, custom types</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If you don't need any of these features there are still many reasons to
                consider using PostgreSQL. Some examples: fantastic documentation for every
                production version, broad user community, stability, and in certain cases,
                performance. There's always the little things: bash completion, command
                line tools for creation/deletion of users and databases, libraries for GIS,
                every version is completely open source, performance tuning in PostgreSQL
                <a href="http://www.varlena.com/GeneralBits/Tidbits/perf.html">is unbelievably flexible for the situation and data in use.</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that I've gotten all that off of my chest, I hope you are at least
                intrigued. I know I have yet to share anything of real value but, fear not,
                as I will be back soon with real examples of usage and some other more
                useful information.

              <h1>Making the New ICS Website</h1>
              <h2>Thanks to Webby, Haml, and Ruby</h2>
              <span class='date'>2009-01-12</span>
              <p>
                Last week I posted on the new ICS website I launched at
                <a href="http://winepos.com">winepos.com</a>
                which is built using the same little ruby gem as this site,
                <a href="http://github.com/TwP/webby/tree/master">Webby.</a>
                This week, I'd like to go into a little more detail on some of the things
                I did in creating their new site. Aside from what little design work I did
                (admittedly not my strongest ability) I will simply be covering many of the
                cool things you can do with Webby and a couple of tips and gotchas.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first step is obviously to create a new project. The webby-gen command
                should handle things nicely. I used the 'website' template because that was
                what I was building. From the basic project, I converted and modified all
                of the files created (layout, templates) to use Haml and to fit with a very
                basic structure that I was going to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the basic structure was in place, I created files for all of the site
                pages I was going to need. I also created directories for the feature pages
                and for the blog posts. At this point, I knew that I was going to be making
                lots of blog posts and so I created a new template for a blog page. A tip
                about templates, and pages in general: you can add any variables you would
                like to the header section of page, and later sort a search on it. Also,
                you can use Erb in a template and it will be interpreted when generating a
                new page from the template. For example, in order to get a solid created_at
                timestamp, I use Time.now.to_y inside an Erb tag.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I started to develop the site I discovered I was reusing pieces of
                content more and more frequently. In Rails/Merb it's trivial to create a
                partial snippet of content, and guess what, it's just as easy using Webby.
                The only thing to make a note of is that partials are looked for in the
                same path as a page being rendered. In order to share across different sub-
                directories you must add a preceding forward slash. For example, this:
                <code>
                  render :partial => "/newsletter_form"
                </code>
                would search for a partial named '_newsletter_form.txt' in the root of the
                content folder. Also note that a different partial can be rendered by a
                layout calling partial from the different sub-directories. The default
                layout could call use partial 'footer' and both the blog and the feature
                folders could have that footer partial with different structure or content.
              </p>
              <p>
                The last thing I'll cover is making an atom feed from a set of pages. A
                similar technique can be used to make an xml sitemap for Google and other
                search engines. A feed is simply a page that has the extension set to xml
                and the markup content of which results in valid xml for the required
                specification. Be sure to set the layout to nil! As for the entries, I like
                to have all of my posts available in the feed, so I use the symbol :all to
                return all pages from find. For example:
                <code>
                  @pages.find(:all, :in_directory => 'blog', :sort_by => 'created_at', :reverse => true)
                </code>
                The alternative would be to set a limit of some sort, like this:
                <code>
                  @pages.find(:limit => 20, :in_directory => 'blog', :sort_by => 'created_at', :reverse => true)
                </code>
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're looking to make a website that is going to be just HTML and you
                don't want to run a webserver aside from Apache or Nginx, Webby is probably
                the way to go. I certainly love it, and will continue to make static
                websites using it.
              </p>

              <h1>New ICS Vision Site</h1>
              <h2>winepos.com</h2>
              <span class='date'>2009-01-07</span>
              <p>
                After starting slowly about 6 months ago, I finally launched the new ICS
                website for their lead product, Vision. The last major commit before launch
                was on Sunday night and by the end of Monday most of the nameservers had
                picked up the change. So go check out the site at
                <a href="http://winepos.com">winepos.com</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                For those that don't know, ICS is a software company founded 25 years ago
                to serve the retail liquor industry, exclusively. Vision is the result of
                all of their effort. Vision provides an amazing number of features and all
                of the controls required for inventory management, ordering, tracking, and,
                of course, point-of-sale.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new site is built with
                <a href="http://webby.rubyforge.org">Webby</a>
                <a href="http://github.com/TwP/webby/tree/master">(source on github)</a>
                and is generated out to HTML. Javascript is handled using jQuery and a few
                other plugins.

              <h1>I Normally Love Debian</h1>
              <h2>As An Application Developer, It Can Hurt</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-12-06</span>
              <p>
                For whatever reason, I needed to upgrade my apt-get-installed copy of
                Postgresql from 8.1 to 8.3. Now, I can understand why, from a sysadmin
                viewpoint, or from the maintainers view, 8.3 is not as stable as previous
                versions. However, as a user, or as an application developer, 8.3 is a much
                better option. It is also certainly reasonable to want to use the new stuff
                available in a new version. Other system choices enable me to use the
                software I want or need. I've been running 8.3 for months on Mac OS X.
              </p>
              <p>
                On Debian Etch it is generally a good idea to add the backports repository
                to the list of sources for apt to use. This gave me the version of
                Postgresql that I wished to use but, unfortunately, it fails to uninstall
                all of the common libraries for the client and server, as well as the dev
                library (libpq-dev) for the appropriate version. This failure in upgrading
                is due to the ability of Postgres to run multiple versioned "clusters" at
                the same time. I however, uninstalled (without doing --purge, my mistake)
                version 8.1 and installed 8.3 and was not trying to run them together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reason this caused problems for me was the native postgres gem for ruby
                was compiling itself with the 8.1 headers and so, data_objects and dm-core
                would refuse to connect to 8.3. Especially infuriating was that I could see
                the server running and could connect with the psql client using the same
                connection information I was providing to DataMapper.
              </p>
              <p>
                The solution was to uninstall everything postgresql related using apt and
                the --purge flag. Taking special care to include libpq4 and libpq-dev in
                that list. Uninstall the postgres gem, as well (and possibly data_objects
                and dm-core).
              </p>
              <p>
                Now add "deb http://www.backports.org/debian etch-backports main contrib
                non-free" into /etc/apt/sources.list and do sudo apt-get update to pull the
                list of packages. Now reinstall postgresql-8.3, libpq5, and libpq-dev and
                be sure to pass the -t etch-backports option so that all the required libs
                get pulled from that repository.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finish up by reinstalling all the required gems and all should be well.
                Note that my experience here is not typical, and in general, being strict
                about package stability is generally a good cause. However, it is a very
                useful to have backports available when needed and the packages there are
                generally more stable than other random repositories.

              <h1>Do We Really Need MobileMe?</h1>
              <h2>Getting By On Google and Dropbox</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-12-04</span>
              <p>
                MobileMe is a pretty awesome service. However, having used it for at least
                six months, I'm pretty well decided that it is not quite worth $100 a year.
                In addition, Google has just released, officially, it's support for CalDAV
                syncing between iCal and Google Calendar. Google's support of IMAP has also
                grown strong over this time period. Last, the final important piece of the
                puzzle is
                <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
                , which is now open for public beta and works very well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Setting up IMAP with google is simple and you can find directions
                <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=75725">here.</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Setting up Google's iCal support is almost as easy, especially with their
                set-up tool. Directions can be found
                <a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=99358#ical">here.</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                The benefits of these combined services speak for themselves, but in any
                case, I'll repeat them here. Dropbox serves to replace the need for iDisk
                sharing since it works by synchronizing all of the files within given
                directories between all of your computers. Dropbox is not only useable on
                Mac OS X and Windows, it now works on Linux (Ubuntu only). CalDAV is also
                completely cross-platform using a product from Mozilla,
                <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/">Sunbird.</a>
                Of course, given my love of OS X, CalDAV works extremely well within iCal
                on Leopard. Finally, email, being the most important of all, works on any
                email client that supports IMAP (almost every client). Not only this but,
                it magically syncs between all computers and my iPhone.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a few remaining features that I don't consider to be critical to
                the service because I don't use them or because there are other services
                that have existed for some time to handle the feature. Photo sharing, for
                example, is more than capably covered by Flickr. The greatest drawback, in
                my opinion, of this piecemeal approach is the lack of a unified website for
                when you are away from your computer. All-in-all, the MobileMe website is
                not worth the  money and neither is MobileMe now, thanks to Google and
                Dropbox.

              <h1>Three Games</h1>
              <h2>In Three Weeks of Midnight Launches</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-11-06</span>
              <p>
                The past three weeks (including tonight) have seen the launch of the three
                biggest games of 2008. Two weeks ago was the launch of Fable 2, the much
                anticipated sequel to an award winning, though short, game by the famed
                Peter Molyneux. Much of the gameplay has been tweaked, the game is much
                longer, and you have a friendly dog to aid your character. Though I am not
                done with the game, my roommate (who is on his second time through) are
                enjoying it thoroughly. Last week, Chris and I were lucky enough to attend
                the launch of Bethesda's version of Fallout, number 3. I have spent more
                time playing through Fallout 3 and, though I'm not done, I would say it is
                more than worthy of a "Best Game of the Year" title.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, tonight, I'll be waiting for Gears of War 2! The original Gears of
                War was very probably my favorite game a short while ago. Aside from Halo 3
                it was the primary reason that I purchased an Xbox 360 while in college. It
                has won many, many awards in the past, and I expect it will win many, many
                more in its second iteration.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope, for the first time in my life, I can play through all of these
                games to something that could be considered completion, if not to complete
                all of the various achievements. If only there were more hours in the day!

              <h1>Merb is Not Rails</h1>
              <h2>And That is Okay</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-05-29</span>
              <p>
                Merb is not Rails.
              </p>
              <p>
                If that statement isn't simple enough for you let me, like
                <a href="http://brainspl.at/articles/2008/05/21/does-it-have-to-be-a-competition-between-rails-and-merb">Ezra</a>
                and
                <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2008/05/21/cant-we-all-just-get-along/">Yehuda</a>
                , explain why Merb is not Rails, why this is good for both Merb and Rails,
                and where this will lead both projects in the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ezra laid out the simple fact that there is no competition between Rails
                and Merb. This comes down to “scratching different itches”. Yehuda’s post
                reiterated this and added a few more important “why”s. Yehuda’s main point
                is in the goal of “hackability” of Merb as a framework in comparison to the
                “get-up-and-go” goal in Rails. Each serves a purpose. Merb’s goal is one
                that served as my impetus for seeking out a Rails alternative. I still use
                Rails because in many cases the “get-up-and-go” route is exactly what I
                need. Rails should stick to its guns, philosophically just as Merb should.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yehuda’s second great point is that those that work on Merb often work on
                Rails and wish to see the experimental developments in Merb move into Rails.
                His example of note is the “provides” api (which many, many Merb people
                love). In the future I hope that Merb as a testbed for Rails continues with
                a bit more stability in Merb, perhaps.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the moment I need to bring more stability to my own install of Merb. I
                have continually worked with the latest and greatest Merb because of my
                need to stay on the cutting edge with DataMapper.

              <h1>Slicehost</h1>
              <h2>Getting it Right, Right Away</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-03-14</span>
              <p>
                At the recommendation of Patrick Reagan of Viget Labs I signed up for an
                account with Slicehost. With a simple form for signup, I was quickly
                filling in my credit card number. Before my credit card had been validated
                by Slicehost, my slice was up and running.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was not planning at the time to set up, or modify my new server. The draw
                of the root password that had just been emailed to me overpowered any such
                plans. I quickly discovered the fantastic tools made available by Slicehost
                for the user. Within 2 minutes I had configured my DNS and within 5 minutes
                I had compiled and installed Nginx, all thanks to the excellent help site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon completing the initial "release" of this website the following
                morning, I was completely up and running and I switched my TLD registration
                to the Slicehost DNS hosts. If you do sign up for a Slicehost account I
                would certainly appreciate a

              <h1>Verizon Fios Internet &amp; TV</h1>
              <h2>Using Your Own Router, Not the Actiontec Router</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-07-08</span>
              <p>
                <h1>The basic steps are as follows:</h1>
                <ol>
                  <li>Order Verizon Fios</li>
                  <li>
                    During installation have the installer turn on the ethernet port in the
                    MOCA, not the coax
                  </li>
                  <li>Have the installer leave you with a "NIM"</li>
                  <li>Setup your router as you would have with any other ISP</li>
                  <li>Connect the "NIM" to your router</li>
                  <li>Connect the "NIM" to a coax port in your house</li>
                  <li>
                    Have the installer connect and activate your television set-top-boxes
                    (STB)
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <h3>Now for some explanation</h3>
              <p>
                I think ordering should be pretty self-explanatory. However, I have not
                said anything about why a sane person would wish to do this instead of
                letting the nice Verizon installer do their job. It's all in the hardware
                Using the Actiontec router Verizon provides is fine, if you've never had a
                wireless home network before. For the rest of us, being allowed to use our
                own, existing, setup is not possible without the foreknowledge or the will
                to fight for the information.
              </p>
              <h3>Onto the more technical stuff</h3>
              <p>
                The MOCA is the box that is left outside of your house. Essentially, it
                receives and interprets the signal. It takes the place of what we once
                called a MODEM. In this box, there are multiple connections, one of which
                is the standard ethernet port any Linksys, DLink, or Apple router knows and
                loves. There is also a port that passes the network information over a coax
                (short for coaxial) cable. This is the port left on by Verizon normally
                because the Actiontec router (which, with a simple google search, one will
                find is nearly worthless) is intended to work with it. Using the ethernet
                port is required so that every other brand of standard router will operate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, we set up our router in much the same way it would be set up with a
                DSL or Cable ISP. Verizon uses the standard, DHCP, to give your router an
                IP address. At this point, assuming the internet has been activated by the
                installer, you should be able to get on the internet at the wonderfully
                blazing speeds that Fios provides.
              </p>
              <p>
                The last major step is asking the installer to give you a "NIM". I never
                found out what "NIM" stood for, but it's purpose is clear. In order to
                get access to the programming guide or to video-on-demand services your
                STBs must have internet access, too. The "NIM" should have two ports. The
                first is an ethernet port and the second is a coax connector. Can you guess
                what to do? Plug an ethernet cable from your router into the "NIM" and plug
                a coax cable into the other port. The final coax connection should be made
                to any coax cable outlet in your home as they are all inter-connected. The
                "NIM" acts as translator in place of the Actiontec router and provides
                internet access for the STBs to use. The STBs do have ethernet ports (at
                least the latest Motorola box Verizon provided) but internet access does
                not appear to be the purpose, but rather, home network connection for
                certain media-sharing capabilities (music, movies, pictures to the TV).
              </p>
              <p>
                At this point, the installer should be able to simply plug in all of your
                STBs and activate them as needed through Verizon.
              </p>
              <p>
                Disclaimer: I am not a Verizon technician. If for some strange reason any
                of these instructions mess up your system I take no responsibility as
                these are only the methods that worked FOR ME. Your Mileage May Vary!
