              <h1>Merb and Subdomains with Nginx</h1>
              <h2>Quick Lessons Learned</h2>
              <span class='date'>2009-02-03</span>
              <p>
                I encountered two issues and learned two quick lessons when deploying a Merb
                application I have been working on. Aside from the fact that you can use
                <code>
                  request.subdomains
                </code>
                to get an array of subdomains, you must do two little things to get this to
                play nice when your application is deployed upstream on Nginx (and likely
                apache, too) as well as handling the same situation in local development.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, in your Nginx configuration file be sure to set the proper header for
                host, otherwise the host that Merb will see is the name you give to the upstream
                section of your configuration. To pass this information on correctly, do this:
                <code>
                  proxy_set_header  Host	 $host;
                </code>
                inside the "location" block for your application's root.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, in order to get the right subdomains, Merb expects you are using a
                TLD or top-level-domain, such as example.com. If you, like me, are using a
                local hostname, such as localhost, you aren't going to get anything when
                you ask for subdomains. So, in /etc/hosts I simply set up a domain pointing
                to 127.0.0.1 for a place I know I'll never go.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope these two little tips will help you to avoid some of the trouble I
                had to deal with, even if it was only 5 minutes of my time, or yours.
              </p>

              <h1>PostgreSQL Part 1</h1>
              <h2>Benefits for Web Application Development</h2>
              <span class='date'>2009-01-26</span>
              <p>
                Most of my days are filled developing with Ruby in frameworks (mostly
                Rails). I use a large array of industry standard tools in doing so and my
                favorite of all, and the one most often overlooked, is the database. Of the
                databases I've worked with, researched, or been witness to,
                <a href="http://postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>
                is my database of choice. In a series of posts I'd like to cover the
                reasons I have for this love of mine, some cool things you can do with it,
                and associated links that I think you might find useful. This first part
                will cover some potential benefits one might find in using PostgreSQL in
                web application development, of all places.
              </p>
              <h3>Benefits with (insert Ruby Framework here)</h3>
              <p>
                Rails with ActiveRecord or Merb with DataMapper are all (with limited
                exception) designed to be database agnostic. Furthermore, they are intended
                to abstract away much of the tedium normally associated with dealing in any
                database. As a result, there is very little direct performance or feature-
                related benefit to be found by simply using PostgreSQL over say, MySQL.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, there exist a number of plugins and gems that enhance the features
                normally provided by our framework of choice. A few, in no particular order:
                <a href="http://github.com/maxim/sexy_pg_constraints/tree/master">sexy_pg_constraints,</a>
                <a href="http://github.com/pka/acts_as_tsearch/tree/master">acts_as_tsearch,</a>
                <a href="http://github.com/dylanz/tsearchable/tree/master">tsearchable,</a>
                <a href="http://github.com/aeden/rails_sql_views/tree/master">rails_sql_views,</a>
                and
                <a href="http://github.com/fesplugas/simplified_fk/tree/master">simplified_fk.</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Maybe then, the benefits are performance related. Unfortunately, neither I,
                nor anyone else (so far), have reliable benchmarks on this. From everything
                I've seen, statistics are done by fans or gurus of one side or another and
                rarely does someone exist who is talented with all the databases being
                compared. Even if some such person existed, where does one set the baseline?
                All of the databases that anyone would want to use have performance tweaks
                that can be performed at a varied level of difficulty. So, who knows? In my
                opinion, whether a database is fast enough or faster than a competitor is
                entirely dependent on the situation and the needs of the problem to be
                solved.
              </p>
              <h3>Features</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Triggers (on both statement and row changes)</li>
                <li>Rules</li>
                <li>Constraints</li>
                <li>Partitioning</li>
                <li>Extremely advanced selects, Views</li>
                <li>Full procedural languages including: ruby, tcl, perl, python, sql</li>
                <li>Security (basic, ident, kerberos, pam, ldap, and more)</li>
                <li>Large Copy</li>
                <li>Built-in Full Text Search</li>
                <li>Extensive datatype collection, custom types</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If you don't need any of these features there are still many reasons to
                consider using PostgreSQL. Some examples: fantastic documentation for every
                production version, broad user community, stability, and in certain cases,
                performance. There's always the little things: bash completion, command
                line tools for creation/deletion of users and databases, libraries for GIS,
                every version is completely open source, performance tuning in PostgreSQL
                <a href="http://www.varlena.com/GeneralBits/Tidbits/perf.html">is unbelievably flexible for the situation and data in use.</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that I've gotten all that off of my chest, I hope you are at least
                intrigued. I know I have yet to share anything of real value but, fear not,
                as I will be back soon with real examples of usage and some other more
                useful information.

              <h1>Making the New ICS Website</h1>
              <h2>Thanks to Webby, Haml, and Ruby</h2>
              <span class='date'>2009-01-12</span>
              <p>
                Last week I posted on the new ICS website I launched at
                <a href="http://winepos.com">winepos.com</a>
                which is built using the same little ruby gem as this site,
                <a href="http://github.com/TwP/webby/tree/master">Webby.</a>
                This week, I'd like to go into a little more detail on some of the things
                I did in creating their new site. Aside from what little design work I did
                (admittedly not my strongest ability) I will simply be covering many of the
                cool things you can do with Webby and a couple of tips and gotchas.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first step is obviously to create a new project. The webby-gen command
                should handle things nicely. I used the 'website' template because that was
                what I was building. From the basic project, I converted and modified all
                of the files created (layout, templates) to use Haml and to fit with a very
                basic structure that I was going to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the basic structure was in place, I created files for all of the site
                pages I was going to need. I also created directories for the feature pages
                and for the blog posts. At this point, I knew that I was going to be making
                lots of blog posts and so I created a new template for a blog page. A tip
                about templates, and pages in general: you can add any variables you would
                like to the header section of page, and later sort a search on it. Also,
                you can use Erb in a template and it will be interpreted when generating a
                new page from the template. For example, in order to get a solid created_at
                timestamp, I use Time.now.to_y inside an Erb tag.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I started to develop the site I discovered I was reusing pieces of
                content more and more frequently. In Rails/Merb it's trivial to create a
                partial snippet of content, and guess what, it's just as easy using Webby.
                The only thing to make a note of is that partials are looked for in the
                same path as a page being rendered. In order to share across different sub-
                directories you must add a preceding forward slash. For example, this:
                <code>
                  render :partial => "/newsletter_form"
                </code>
                would search for a partial named '_newsletter_form.txt' in the root of the
                content folder. Also note that a different partial can be rendered by a
                layout calling partial from the different sub-directories. The default
                layout could call use partial 'footer' and both the blog and the feature
                folders could have that footer partial with different structure or content.
              </p>
              <p>
                The last thing I'll cover is making an atom feed from a set of pages. A
                similar technique can be used to make an xml sitemap for Google and other
                search engines. A feed is simply a page that has the extension set to xml
                and the markup content of which results in valid xml for the required
                specification. Be sure to set the layout to nil! As for the entries, I like
                to have all of my posts available in the feed, so I use the symbol :all to
                return all pages from find. For example:
                <code>
                  @pages.find(:all, :in_directory => 'blog', :sort_by => 'created_at', :reverse => true)
                </code>
                The alternative would be to set a limit of some sort, like this:
                <code>
                  @pages.find(:limit => 20, :in_directory => 'blog', :sort_by => 'created_at', :reverse => true)
                </code>
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're looking to make a website that is going to be just HTML and you
                don't want to run a webserver aside from Apache or Nginx, Webby is probably
                the way to go. I certainly love it, and will continue to make static
                websites using it.
              </p>

              <h1>New ICS Vision Site</h1>
              <h2>winepos.com</h2>
              <span class='date'>2009-01-07</span>
              <p>
                After starting slowly about 6 months ago, I finally launched the new ICS
                website for their lead product, Vision. The last major commit before launch
                was on Sunday night and by the end of Monday most of the nameservers had
                picked up the change. So go check out the site at
                <a href="http://winepos.com">winepos.com</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                For those that don't know, ICS is a software company founded 25 years ago
                to serve the retail liquor industry, exclusively. Vision is the result of
                all of their effort. Vision provides an amazing number of features and all
                of the controls required for inventory management, ordering, tracking, and,
                of course, point-of-sale.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new site is built with
                <a href="http://webby.rubyforge.org">Webby</a>
                <a href="http://github.com/TwP/webby/tree/master">(source on github)</a>
                and is generated out to HTML. Javascript is handled using jQuery and a few
                other plugins.

              <span class='date'>2008-12-06</span>
              <p>
                For whatever reason, I needed to upgrade my apt-get-installed copy of
                Postgresql from 8.1 to 8.3. Now, I can understand why, from a sysadmin
                viewpoint, or from the maintainers view, 8.3 is not as stable as previous
                versions. However, as a user, or as an application developer, 8.3 is a much
                better option. It is also certainly reasonable to want to use the new stuff
                available in a new version. Other system choices enable me to use the
                software I want or need. I've been running 8.3 for months on Mac OS X.
              </p>
              <p>
                On Debian Etch it is generally a good idea to add the backports repository
                to the list of sources for apt to use. This gave me the version of
                Postgresql that I wished to use but, unfortunately, it fails to uninstall
                all of the common libraries for the client and server, as well as the dev
                library (libpq-dev) for the appropriate version. This failure in upgrading
                is due to the ability of Postgres to run multiple versioned "clusters" at
                the same time. I however, uninstalled (without doing --purge, my mistake)
                version 8.1 and installed 8.3 and was not trying to run them together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reason this caused problems for me was the native postgres gem for ruby
                was compiling itself with the 8.1 headers and so, data_objects and dm-core
                would refuse to connect to 8.3. Especially infuriating was that I could see
                the server running and could connect with the psql client using the same
                connection information I was providing to DataMapper.
              </p>
              <p>
                The solution was to uninstall everything postgresql related using apt and
                the --purge flag. Taking special care to include libpq4 and libpq-dev in
                that list. Uninstall the postgres gem, as well (and possibly data_objects
                and dm-core).
              </p>
              <p>
                Now add "deb http://www.backports.org/debian etch-backports main contrib
                non-free" into /etc/apt/sources.list and do sudo apt-get update to pull the
                list of packages. Now reinstall postgresql-8.3, libpq5, and libpq-dev and
                be sure to pass the -t etch-backports option so that all the required libs
                get pulled from that repository.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finish up by reinstalling all the required gems and all should be well.
                Note that my experience here is not typical, and in general, being strict
                about package stability is generally a good cause. However, it is a very
                useful to have backports available when needed and the packages there are
                generally more stable than other random repositories.

              <h1>Do We Really Need MobileMe?</h1>
              <h2>Getting By On Google and Dropbox</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-12-04</span>
              <p>
                MobileMe is a pretty awesome service. However, having used it for at least
                six months, I'm pretty well decided that it is not quite worth $100 a year.
                In addition, Google has just released, officially, it's support for CalDAV
                syncing between iCal and Google Calendar. Google's support of IMAP has also
                grown strong over this time period. Last, the final important piece of the
                puzzle is
                <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
                , which is now open for public beta and works very well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Setting up IMAP with google is simple and you can find directions
                <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=75725">here.</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Setting up Google's iCal support is almost as easy, especially with their
                set-up tool. Directions can be found
                <a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=99358#ical">here.</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                The benefits of these combined services speak for themselves, but in any
                case, I'll repeat them here. Dropbox serves to replace the need for iDisk
                sharing since it works by synchronizing all of the files within given
                directories between all of your computers. Dropbox is not only useable on
                Mac OS X and Windows, it now works on Linux (Ubuntu only). CalDAV is also
                completely cross-platform using a product from Mozilla,
                <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/">Sunbird.</a>
                Of course, given my love of OS X, CalDAV works extremely well within iCal
                on Leopard. Finally, email, being the most important of all, works on any
                email client that supports IMAP (almost every client). Not only this but,
                it magically syncs between all computers and my iPhone.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a few remaining features that I don't consider to be critical to
                the service because I don't use them or because there are other services
                that have existed for some time to handle the feature. Photo sharing, for
                example, is more than capably covered by Flickr. The greatest drawback, in
                my opinion, of this piecemeal approach is the lack of a unified website for
                when you are away from your computer. All-in-all, the MobileMe website is
                not worth the  money and neither is MobileMe now, thanks to Google and
                Dropbox.

              <h1>Three Games</h1>
              <h2>In Three Weeks of Midnight Launches</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-11-06</span>
              <p>
                The past three weeks (including tonight) have seen the launch of the three
                biggest games of 2008. Two weeks ago was the launch of Fable 2, the much
                anticipated sequel to an award winning, though short, game by the famed
                Peter Molyneux. Much of the gameplay has been tweaked, the game is much
                longer, and you have a friendly dog to aid your character. Though I am not
                done with the game, my roommate (who is on his second time through) are
                enjoying it thoroughly. Last week, Chris and I were lucky enough to attend
                the launch of Bethesda's version of Fallout, number 3. I have spent more
                time playing through Fallout 3 and, though I'm not done, I would say it is
                more than worthy of a "Best Game of the Year" title.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, tonight, I'll be waiting for Gears of War 2! The original Gears of
                War was very probably my favorite game a short while ago. Aside from Halo 3
                it was the primary reason that I purchased an Xbox 360 while in college. It
                has won many, many awards in the past, and I expect it will win many, many
                more in its second iteration.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope, for the first time in my life, I can play through all of these
                games to something that could be considered completion, if not to complete
                all of the various achievements. If only there were more hours in the day!

              <h1>Vision Online, Now Focus</h1>
              <h2>The exciting tale of a Merb Application and branding</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-03-11</span>
              <p>
                I have spent my free time, nights and weekends, working to create a new
                version of Vision, online. For those that do not know, Vision is the
                peerless, just-in-time, inventory control and point of sale system for the
                retail liquor market.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project was originally titled Vision Online. That name is simple and
                it works with all of the branding that
                <a href="http://www.ics-nj.com">ICS</a>
                has already done. However, this product heads out on its own and addresses
                a slightly new market. As such, a new name was a must.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thanks to a stroke of genius by my associate Chris, we've switched to the
                name Focus. The name is brilliant for three, important, reasons. First,
                the original product is named Vision and Focus is just that, a focusing of
                the features and benefits of using Vision. Second, the use of this
                product is intended to focus the users' inventory until it is as close as
                possible to just-in-time. Lastly, a function of a person's literal vision
                is the ability to focus. We are hoping that this reincarnation of Vision
                will enable a user to focus on getting their inventory in line and online.
              </p>
              <p>
                Solidifying this branding was important for me, as a developer, because it
                provides a northern star, a guiding light, to my goal. The meaning that
                branding holds for a user is realized many times over, for me. It is an
                important aspect of development, keeping the goals, ideals, and vision of
                the product, in mind.

              <h2>So Much to Do</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-05-27</span>
              <p>
                The short story is:
                <a href="http://www.viget.com">Viget</a>
                is being extremely generous and is paying for me to travel to
                <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home">RailsConf</a>
                this year. Despite the fact that I have only been in their employ for three
                whole weeks. I'm extremely happy working there and I only hope that I am
                living up to their expectations of me.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am excited to go to RailsConf for two reasons. First, I have never been
                to a conference before, any conference, and I really expect to learn a lot
                in the sessions I am enrolled in. Second, I may finally get to meet many of
                the people I talk to on the irc chat rooms for Merb and DataMapper. People
                like Yehuda Katz, Ezra Z., Adam French (who I think is going), and a
                coworker from Viget South, Ben Scofield, who will be speaking, as well. All
                in all I have extremely high hopes for this trip.
              </p>
              <p>
                In other news, I've got draft copies of many, many blog posts. The problem
                is trying to decide where they will be appropriate. Some are about the beta
                for
                <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
                (my favorite service, at the moment), including some nifty tricks. Another
                post is a followup to Getting Things Done with Mail and iCal combined with
                a review of the GTD application, Things. On the
                <a href="http://www.viget.com/extend/">Viget Extend blog</a>
                , I've got some ideas for posts on topics ranging from Microsoft Exchange
                calendar subscriptions in iCal to accessing the LDAP global address list
                from Address Book.
