              <h1>I Normally Love Debian</h1>
              <h2>As An Application Developer, It Can Hurt</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-12-06</span>
              <p>
                For whatever reason, I needed to upgrade my apt-get-installed copy of
                Postgresql from 8.1 to 8.3. Now, I can understand why, from a sysadmin
                viewpoint, or from the maintainers view, 8.3 is not as stable as previous
                versions. However, as a user, or as an application developer, 8.3 is a much
                better option. It is also certainly reasonable to want to use the new stuff
                available in a new version. Other system choices enable me to use the
                software I want or need. I've been running 8.3 for months on Mac OS X.
              </p>
              <p>
                On Debian Etch it is generally a good idea to add the backports repository
                to the list of sources for apt to use. This gave me the version of
                Postgresql that I wished to use but, unfortunately, it fails to uninstall
                all of the common libraries for the client and server, as well as the dev
                library (libpq-dev) for the appropriate version. This failure in upgrading
                is due to the ability of Postgres to run multiple versioned "clusters" at
                the same time. I however, uninstalled (without doing --purge, my mistake)
                version 8.1 and installed 8.3 and was not trying to run them together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reason this caused problems for me was the native postgres gem for ruby
                was compiling itself with the 8.1 headers and so, data_objects and dm-core
                would refuse to connect to 8.3. Especially infuriating was that I could see
                the server running and could connect with the psql client using the same
                connection information I was providing to DataMapper.
              </p>
              <p>
                The solution was to uninstall everything postgresql related using apt and
                the --purge flag. Taking special care to include libpq4 and libpq-dev in
                that list. Uninstall the postgres gem, as well (and possibly data_objects
                and dm-core).
              </p>
              <p>
                Now add "deb http://www.backports.org/debian etch-backports main contrib
                non-free" into /etc/apt/sources.list and do sudo apt-get update to pull the
                list of packages. Now reinstall postgresql-8.3, libpq5, and libpq-dev and
                be sure to pass the -t etch-backports option so that all the required libs
                get pulled from that repository.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finish up by reinstalling all the required gems and all should be well.
                Note that my experience here is not typical, and in general, being strict
                about package stability is generally a good cause. However, it is a very
                useful to have backports available when needed and the packages there are
                generally more stable than other random repositories.

              <h1>Do We Really Need MobileMe?</h1>
              <h2>Getting By On Google and Dropbox</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-12-04</span>
              <p>
                MobileMe is a pretty awesome service. However, having used it for at least
                six months, I'm pretty well decided that it is not quite worth $100 a year.
                In addition, Google has just released, officially, it's support for CalDAV
                syncing between iCal and Google Calendar. Google's support of IMAP has also
                grown strong over this time period. Last, the final important piece of the
                puzzle is
                <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
                , which is now open for public beta and works very well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Setting up IMAP with google is simple and you can find directions
                <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=75725">here.</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Setting up Google's iCal support is almost as easy, especially with their
                set-up tool. Directions can be found
                <a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=99358#ical">here.</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                The benefits of these combined services speak for themselves, but in any
                case, I'll repeat them here. Dropbox serves to replace the need for iDisk
                sharing since it works by synchronizing all of the files within given
                directories between all of your computers. Dropbox is not only useable on
                Mac OS X and Windows, it now works on Linux (Ubuntu only). CalDAV is also
                completely cross-platform using a product from Mozilla,
                <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/">Sunbird.</a>
                Of course, given my love of OS X, CalDAV works extremely well within iCal
                on Leopard. Finally, email, being the most important of all, works on any
                email client that supports IMAP (almost every client). Not only this but,
                it magically syncs between all computers and my iPhone.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a few remaining features that I don't consider to be critical to
                the service because I don't use them or because there are other services
                that have existed for some time to handle the feature. Photo sharing, for
                example, is more than capably covered by Flickr. The greatest drawback, in
                my opinion, of this piecemeal approach is the lack of a unified website for
                when you are away from your computer. All-in-all, the MobileMe website is
                not worth the  money and neither is MobileMe now, thanks to Google and
                Dropbox.

              <h1>Three Games</h1>
              <h2>In Three Weeks of Midnight Launches</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-11-06</span>
              <p>
                The past three weeks (including tonight) have seen the launch of the three
                biggest games of 2008. Two weeks ago was the launch of Fable 2, the much
                anticipated sequel to an award winning, though short, game by the famed
                Peter Molyneux. Much of the gameplay has been tweaked, the game is much
                longer, and you have a friendly dog to aid your character. Though I am not
                done with the game, my roommate (who is on his second time through) are
                enjoying it thoroughly. Last week, Chris and I were lucky enough to attend
                the launch of Bethesda's version of Fallout, number 3. I have spent more
                time playing through Fallout 3 and, though I'm not done, I would say it is
                more than worthy of a "Best Game of the Year" title.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, tonight, I'll be waiting for Gears of War 2! The original Gears of
                War was very probably my favorite game a short while ago. Aside from Halo 3
                it was the primary reason that I purchased an Xbox 360 while in college. It
                has won many, many awards in the past, and I expect it will win many, many
                more in its second iteration.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope, for the first time in my life, I can play through all of these
                games to something that could be considered completion, if not to complete
                all of the various achievements. If only there were more hours in the day!

              <h1>Legacy Databases with ActiveRecord</h1>
              <h2>So Close, But Yet, So Far</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-03-17</span>
              <p>
                I loved working with Ruby on Rails, I still do. I bought books, I read
                blogs, and I made a fair few sites (both personal and for clients). I
                thought Ruby on Rails was the be-all, end-all for web development. I was
                very wrong.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ruby on Rails is fantastic. Especially when you create a new application
                and design and create that web application with Rails, and its way, in
                mind. However, if, like myself, you have to work with the database from
                an application that originated nearly 20 years ago, you may hit some snags.
                Just as I did.
              </p>
              <p>
                The design of a database to be used with Ruby on Rails (specifically
                ActiveRecord) must adhere to some very stringent "best" practices. These
                are not always the absolute, best practices in design but, they provide
                some fairly standard basic practices. One such example, though fairly
                advanced comes with polymorphic associations. In defining the type in one
                such association, ActiveRecord uses the class name of the type instead of
                a secondary table listing all possible types. This breaks any possible use
                of a foreign-key constraint.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some basics in Ruby on Rails database design, which is often generated
                without any specification from the developer (when using model generators),
                include: tables are named the pluralized class name (e.g. User becomes
                users), every table has an "id" field that is an auto-incremented integer,
                and a foreign-key is tablename_id.
              </p>
              <p>
                What must we do if we are using an existing database, and it does not
                comply to these standards? I'll go through each instance of non-standard
                database design from the existing database and show how ActiveRecord did
                or did not handle the problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                What to do if a Table is not Named after a Class? Easy. ActiveRecord
                provides a simple method
                <code>set_table_name</code>
                that allows you to do just that. If the tables are named after a class but
                are not pluralized, you can simply set the environment to not use the
                pluralized versions.
              </p>
              <p>
                What to do if a Table does not have Primary Key named 'id'? Easy, too.
                Simply use
                <code>set_primary_key</code>
                to set the primary key. This does not, however, provide for a case in which
                a table does not have a primary key (or otherwise usable unique key) in any
                way, shape, or form. The simple answer is to add an 'id' field that is not
                used by the legacy application. This is difficult or impossible to do if
                you are not the person in control of the database. It is also difficult if,
                like me, the database exists on hundreds of servers distributed around the
                country. Making any change in this case is not a simple undertaking.
              </p>
              <p>
                What to do if the Primary Key is not an auto-incremented integer field?
                Here, we find the most difficult problem of all. ActiveRecord can ignore
                the fact that you don't have auto-incremented values but, if your key is
                not an integer ActiveRecord (as of this posting) hits the proverbial wall.
                In the case of my legacy database, the primary keys were text fields, five
                digits in length. This was a carry-over from an even older system in which
                no relational database was involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                My only options here became extremely complicated and were only possible
                because I was using Postgresql (editable views). That was the end of the
                road for this project and Ruby on Rails. Thankfully, a helpful suggestion
                led me to use
                <a href="http://merbivore.com">Merb</a>
                for my framework and
                <a href="http://datamapper.org">DataMapper</a>
                for my database ORM. Watch for my next post in which I discuss the solutions
                to these problems, and a few nice perks, found in Merb and DataMapper.

                is being extremely generous and is paying for me to travel to
                <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home">RailsConf</a>
                this year. Despite the fact that I have only been in their employ for three
                whole weeks. I'm extremely happy working there and I only hope that I am
                living up to their expectations of me.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am excited to go to RailsConf for two reasons. First, I have never been
                to a conference before, any conference, and I really expect to learn a lot
                in the sessions I am enrolled in. Second, I may finally get to meet many of
                the people I talk to on the irc chat rooms for Merb and DataMapper. People
                like Yehuda Katz, Ezra Z., Adam French (who I think is going), and a
                coworker from Viget South, Ben Scofield, who will be speaking, as well. All
                in all I have extremely high hopes for this trip.
              </p>
              <p>
                In other news, I've got draft copies of many, many blog posts. The problem
                is trying to decide where they will be appropriate. Some are about the beta
                for
                <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
                (my favorite service, at the moment), including some nifty tricks. Another
                post is a followup to Getting Things Done with Mail and iCal combined with
                a review of the GTD application, Things. On the
                <a href="http://www.viget.com/extend/">Viget Extend blog</a>
                , I've got some ideas for posts on topics ranging from Microsoft Exchange
                calendar subscriptions in iCal to accessing the LDAP global address list
                from Address Book.

              <h1>Vision Online, Now Focus</h1>
              <h2>The exciting tale of a Merb Application and branding</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-03-11</span>
              <p>
                I have spent my free time, nights and weekends, working to create a new
                version of Vision, online. For those that do not know, Vision is the
                peerless, just-in-time, inventory control and point of sale system for the
                retail liquor market.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project was originally titled Vision Online. That name is simple and
                it works with all of the branding that
                <a href="http://www.ics-nj.com">ICS</a>
                has already done. However, this product heads out on its own and addresses
                a slightly new market. As such, a new name was a must.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thanks to a stroke of genius by my associate Chris, we've switched to the
                name Focus. The name is brilliant for three, important, reasons. First,
                the original product is named Vision and Focus is just that, a focusing of
                the features and benefits of using Vision. Second, the use of this
                product is intended to focus the users' inventory until it is as close as
                possible to just-in-time. Lastly, a function of a person's literal vision
                is the ability to focus. We are hoping that this reincarnation of Vision
                will enable a user to focus on getting their inventory in line and online.
              </p>
              <p>
                Solidifying this branding was important for me, as a developer, because it
                provides a northern star, a guiding light, to my goal. The meaning that
                branding holds for a user is realized many times over, for me. It is an
                important aspect of development, keeping the goals, ideals, and vision of
                the product, in mind.
              </p>

              <h1>Beta Testing the Slicehost API</h1>
              <h2>A Foray into ActiveResource and DNS Records</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-03-21</span>
              <p>
                I was fortunate enough to join slicehost this past week. It is a fantastic
                service, possibly the best VPS I've encountered. While perusing their forum
                as I am want to do from time to time, I noticed a new post by a slicehost
                employee requesting beta-testers (a favorite phrase of mine) for their new
                API. I've used ActiveResource in the past and I thought it would be worth a
                shot.
              </p>
              <p>
                I threw in my hat on the forum and was summarily rewarded with an email
                from a slicehost employee. I was given an API key and some documentation
                with examples in Ruby and Python. Given my ActiveResource experience I
                immediately went to work with their example. It was a breeze and one that
                I am delighted to say any Rubyist would be able to complete.
              </p>
              <p>
                I completed the example, messed around a bit more, and then I retired for
                the evening. The next day I received a short questionnaire which I
                dutifully filled out and returned. My tinkering was not over, however. Oh,
                no. The next free chance I had, I dove right in. Given the access the beta
                provided I could create only two things off the top of my head. The first,
                a dynamic-dns-type updater. The second, a monitor of system status.
              </p>
              <p>
                So far, I have only completed the dynamic dns updater. It is crude but, it
                provides the basic functionality required. It allows you to provide a
                Zone and a Record, as well as, the IP address to use when updating the
                record. If you do not provide an IP address, the current external IP of
                your location will be used.
              </p>
              <p>
                The point of all this is I can have a domain name pointing to my home IP.
                If my provider changes my IP for whatever reason, the script, run by cron
                on a regular basis will tell slicehost, my DNS provider, that my home IP
                address has changed within a reasonable amount of time.

              <h1>Slicehost</h1>
              <h2>Getting it Right, Right Away</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-03-14</span>
              <p>
                At the recommendation of Patrick Reagan of Viget Labs I signed up for an
                account with Slicehost. With a simple form for signup, I was quickly
                filling in my credit card number. Before my credit card had been validated
                by Slicehost, my slice was up and running.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was not planning at the time to set up, or modify my new server. The draw
                of the root password that had just been emailed to me overpowered any such
                plans. I quickly discovered the fantastic tools made available by Slicehost
                for the user. Within 2 minutes I had configured my DNS and within 5 minutes
                I had compiled and installed Nginx, all thanks to the excellent help site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon completing the initial "release" of this website the following
                morning, I was completely up and running and I switched my TLD registration
                to the Slicehost DNS hosts. If you do sign up for a Slicehost account I
                would certainly appreciate a
                <a href="https://manage.slicehost.com/customers/new?referrer=972292314">referral.</a>

              <h1>Barack Obama</h1>
              <h2>Experience is Everything</h2>
              <span class='date'>2008-04-06</span>
              <p>
                I won't often speak of politics. In fact, I would like this to be my one
                and only post on the subject.
                <b>
                  I am a Barack Obama supporter.
                </b>
                The man says a lot of things, just as every other candidate has. However,
                as I've learned, few can back it up. Yes, John McCain was a POW. That is
                horrible but, has no bearing on his ability to be president. His health
                should be of much greater concern. As for Hillary, she talks a whole lot.
                A significant amount of hatred spews from her mouth. On top of that, many
                claims that she makes are only true in the simplest sense. For example, she
                speaks of how she has introduced legislation to improve healthcare and the
                related industry and regulations. What she doesn't say is that very little
                of her legislation passes or is even supported by her peers. Many of these
                bills introduced speak very vaguely about "improving healthcare at sometime
                in the future", without ever mentioning how or when.
              </p>
              <p>
                Something I have learned working in the IT/Software industry, in a very
                short time, is that time does NOT equal experience. I know many a developer
                that has worked for 20 years and has little more real experience than
                another particular developer, one who had only been in the corporate world
                for 2, maybe 3, years. It is the passion that drives us all. This passion
                leads a person to find the experience because it is something they want.
                For many, it is something that simply may or may not happen over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you want to understand just how passionate Barack Obama is, look at how
                passionate his followers are. Barack Obama's passion drives others to be
                just as passionate. This could also be seen in another characteristic of
                Bill Clinton. As Chris Rock used to say in a show, "Bill Clinton is so
                famous, someone else got famous just from sucking his dick!"
              </p>
              <p>
                Granted, passion isn't everything but, it drives a person to seek out the
                many other characteristics that make an exceptional person. The traits and
                abilities that a person must possess to be the president. Barack Obama has
                these traits and abilities. He may not have been a POW but, he has the
                necessary abilities at the most basic level to achieve anything he wants.
                In addition, we must face the fact that nothing will ever prepare a person
                truly for being one of the most powerful people in the world. So, we must
                look to the building blocks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another excellent measure of a person's character and merit is in the way
                they communicate to the public. Barack Obama, and his campaign, do not
                speak hatefully of any other person. Even when it is well deserved, honest
                and would sometimes be necessary. This type of level-headed behavior is
                precisely what the country needs, right now. Excitable behavior, lack of
                quality information has gotten this country in way over its head in war,
                death, debt, and built as a reputation that contrives an extreme level of
                hatred from nearly every other country in the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are only a few of the multitude of "things" that are required to be
                the president. No one person can ever speak of every quality necessary. My
                only fear at this point is that something, someone, is going to screw it up
                for the rest of the country.
