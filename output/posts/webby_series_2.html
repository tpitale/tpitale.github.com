            <h2>Essential Features</h2>
            <span class='date'>2008-04-13</span>
            <p>
              In my first post (
              <a href="/posts/webby_series_1.html">Webby - Part 1</a>
              ) I gave a basic description of
              <a href="http://webby.rubyforge.org/">Webby,</a>
              a ultra-lightweight content management tool. In this post, I intend to
              cover the most essential features of Webby, starting with the creation of a
              new project and an overview of the rake tasks. From there I'll cover some
              of the helper methods that come with Webby.
            </p>
            <h3>What is Webby Doing?</h3>
            <p>
              Webby is useful because it allows the use of Ruby code as well as helpers,
              layouts, partials, filters (more on that later), and templates. From this
              Webby will create the file structure and html (or xml, atom, rss, etc.).
              This, seems to be done, in a very basic sense, by "running" the Ruby
              through one time and saving the files created. This is similar to what a
              page cache would do but, it is done manually due to the infrequency of an
              update.
            </p>
            <h3>Install Webby</h3>
            <p>
              First, in order to use Webby you have to install it. Thankfully, there is a
              gem, making this step very simple. Open the Terminal application (or what
              you would normally use to install a gem) and install Webby (with any
              dependencies).
              <code>sudo gem install webby</code>
            </p>
            <h3>Optional Installs</h3>
            <p>
              Personally, I like using Haml, so I installed that already. Webby is able
              to use a series of "filters" to make use of Haml, Sass, Textile, Markdown,
              and by default, erb. On top of the filters available to transform text,
              Webby has support for CodeRay and UltraViolet syntax highlighting.
            </p>
            <h3>Create a Project</h3>
            <p>
              Onto creating a project. Webby comes with a command, webby. We use this and
              the name of our project in one command and Webby will create the structure
              for the project, in the current location in the filesystem. To view the
              full list of options for the webby command, add the -h/--help flag (Hint:
              there aren't many).
              <code>webby your_project_name_here</code>
            </p>
            <h3>Rake Tasks</h3>
            <p>
              Many Ruby developers are experienced using Rake. Change to the project
              directory in Terminal and try this.
              <code>rake -T</code>
              The most frequently used tasks (for me, at least) are:
              <code>
                rake create:whatever
                <br />
                rake autobuild
                <br />
                rake deploy:however
              </code>
              <span>
                The create task is provided a type of document to create (from a template).
                By default these include a page, a partial, or an atom feed. I will discuss
                adding to these templates in my next post.
              </span>
              <span>
                The autobuild tasks starts the included heel webserver and builds the files
                whenever it detects a "dirty" or changed file. This is very handy in
                development because you can instantly check your changes in a browser.
              </span>
              <span>
                Finally, the deploy task. Using either rsync or ssh, Webby will deploy the
                output files to your designated webserver.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>

              <a href="http://webby.rubyforge.org/tutorial/">official tutorial from Webby.</a>
            </p>
            <p class='next'>
              Next time I'll talk about extending these essential features, making Webby
              an extremely powerful tool.
