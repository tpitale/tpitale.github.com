            <h2>Because iSlayer is Awesome</h2>
            <span class='date'>2008-07-10</span>
            <p>
              I posted awhile back about my attempts at using
              <a href="http://www.culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>
              for my GTD needs. While Cultured Code has made an amazing application,
              even in beta, I was finding myself with features I didn't want and missing
              some features I did want.
            </p>
            <p>
              As such, I've learned to make due using a fine combination of iCal and Mail
              for to do lists. Now, with the addition of something
              <a href="http://www.islayer.com/index.php?op=item&amp;id=64">new from the fine developers at iSlayer</a>
              I have a wonderful little widget that lets me integrate perfectly into
              this system I've got going. Organized is the name of the new widget and I
              think it fits precisely. Now, I don't have to leave Mail or iCal running
              for all the times that I'm on my Mac (which is a lot).
            </p>
            <p>
              Organized is beautifully crafted, as all iSlayer widgets and products that
              I have encountered. As you can see from the screenshots on the web page
              Organized is dominated by the calendar at the top, which is just how I like
              it. Beneath are four tabs: clocks, notes, events, and to dos. I do not
              often use the notes and I have yet to have a real use for clocks. However,
              having events present (with which you can see events in the coming days)
              has been extremely useful for getting my head around an ever more populous
              calendar.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last tab, to dos, is the tab I use most. Mostly because it adds such a
              simple, quick, and perfectly powerful list. While at the same time, those
              to dos work their way back into the rest of my system, for when I do have
              Mail or iCal open, I like to have access to those to dos. I've learned to
              organize my buckets as calendars that accurately represent my life. Around
              these calendars I create groups that mimic the major focuses, life and
              work. Perfect!
