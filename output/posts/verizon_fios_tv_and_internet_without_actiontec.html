            <h1>Verizon Fios Internet &amp; TV</h1>
            <h2>Using Your Own Router, Not the Actiontec Router</h2>
            <span class='date'>2008-07-08</span>
            <p>
              <h3>The basic steps are as follows:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Order Verizon Fios</li>
                <li>
                  During installation have the installer turn on the ethernet port in the
                  MOCA, not the coax
                </li>
                <li>Have the installer leave you with a "NIM"</li>
                <li>Setup your router as you would have with any other ISP</li>
                <li>Connect the "NIM" to your router</li>
                <li>Connect the "NIM" to a coax port in your house</li>
                <li>
                  Have the installer connect and activate your television set-top-boxes
                  (STB)
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>Now for some explanation</h3>
            <p>
              I think ordering should be pretty self-explanatory. However, I have not
              said anything about why a sane person would wish to do this instead of
              letting the nice Verizon installer do their job. It's all in the hardware
              Using the Actiontec router Verizon provides is fine, if you've never had a
              wireless home network before. For the rest of us, being allowed to use our
              own, existing, setup is not possible without the foreknowledge or the will
              to fight for the information.
            </p>
            <h3>Onto the more technical stuff</h3>
            <p>
              The MOCA is the box that is left outside of your house. Essentially, it
              receives and interprets the signal. It takes the place of what we once
              called a MODEM. In this box, there are multiple connections, one of which
              is the standard ethernet port any Linksys, DLink, or Apple router knows and
              loves. There is also a port that passes the network information over a coax
              (short for coaxial) cable. This is the port left on by Verizon normally
              because the Actiontec router (which, with a simple google search, one will
              find is nearly worthless) is intended to work with it. Using the ethernet
              port is required so that every other brand of standard router will operate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, we set up our router in much the same way it would be set up with a
              DSL or Cable ISP. Verizon uses the standard, DHCP, to give your router an
              IP address. At this point, assuming the internet has been activated by the
              installer, you should be able to get on the internet at the wonderfully
              blazing speeds that Fios provides.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last major step is asking the installer to give you a "NIM". I never
              found out what "NIM" stood for, but it's purpose is clear. In order to
              get access to the programming guide or to video-on-demand services your
              STBs must have internet access, too. The "NIM" should have two ports. The
              first is an ethernet port and the second is a coax connector. Can you guess
              what to do? Plug an ethernet cable from your router into the "NIM" and plug
              a coax cable into the other port. The final coax connection should be made
              to any coax cable outlet in your home as they are all inter-connected. The
              "NIM" acts as translator in place of the Actiontec router and provides
              internet access for the STBs to use. The STBs do have ethernet ports (at
              least the latest Motorola box Verizon provided) but internet access does
              not appear to be the purpose, but rather, home network connection for
              certain media-sharing capabilities (music, movies, pictures to the TV).
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point, the installer should be able to simply plug in all of your
              STBs and activate them as needed through Verizon.
            </p>

              Disclaimer: I am not a Verizon technician. If for some strange reason any
              of these instructions mess up your system I take no responsibility as
              these are only the methods that worked FOR ME. Your Mileage May Vary!
