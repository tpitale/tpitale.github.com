            <h1>Three Games</h1>
            <h2>In Three Weeks of Midnight Launches</h2>
            <span class='date'>2008-11-06</span>
            <p>
              The past three weeks (including tonight) have seen the launch of the three
              biggest games of 2008. Two weeks ago was the launch of Fable 2, the much
              anticipated sequel to an award winning, though short, game by the famed
              Peter Molyneux. Much of the gameplay has been tweaked, the game is much
              longer, and you have a friendly dog to aid your character. Though I am not
              done with the game, my roommate (who is on his second time through) are
              enjoying it thoroughly. Last week, Chris and I were lucky enough to attend
              the launch of Bethesda's version of Fallout, number 3. I have spent more
              time playing through Fallout 3 and, though I'm not done, I would say it is
              more than worthy of a "Best Game of the Year" title.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, tonight, I'll be waiting for Gears of War 2! The original Gears of
              War was very probably my favorite game a short while ago. Aside from Halo 3
              it was the primary reason that I purchased an Xbox 360 while in college. It
              has won many, many awards in the past, and I expect it will win many, many
              more in its second iteration.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope, for the first time in my life, I can play through all of these
              games to something that could be considered completion, if not to complete
              all of the various achievements. If only there were more hours in the day!
            </p>
