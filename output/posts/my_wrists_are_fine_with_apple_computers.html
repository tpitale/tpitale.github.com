              How could I forget the voice of my high school typing teacher, constantly
              nagging me to keep my wrists elevated above the keyboard in an horrific
              and uncomfortable position. After all of these years I've never, ever
              been able to accomplish any typing in this fashion. So, my wrists have
              always rested comfortably, but precariously, upon whatever surface my
              keyboard is resting upon. For many years, this surface would have been a
              simple table or desk as I would type at a basic keyboard as I worked in
              Windows. Luckily, for me, I have moved away from the Windows world. As
              such, I am now solely reliant upon Apple's hardware creations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet, I have somehow come through unscathed. While an unlucky associate of
              mine did not share the same luck and was required to undergo a simple,
              preventive, surgery. After much (well, not that much) contemplation, the
              only justification for this that I can arrive at is Apple's hardware. It is
              so thin that, in the case of the latest wired and wireless keyboards from
              Apple, it might as well be the desk. Therefore, the raised wrists position
              is not a requirement. The same affect is accomplished when using a laptop.
              However, this applies to all laptops. Now, looking back, I can recall a
              pair of keyboards, from Logitech, that would also be thin enough to allow
              a user to safely rest their wrists upon their computing surface.
