            <h1>Ezra Introduces Vertebra at RailsConf 2008</h1>
            <h2>Configuration Through the Clouds</h2>
            <span class='date'>2008-06-01</span>
            <p>
              Ezra Z.'s talk at RailsConf 2008 started out normally enough but, his first
              point of order was to introduce Vertebra. Vertebra is similar in purpose to
              Capistrano. Instead of using a linear interface such as SSH, Vertebra uses
              XMPP (the protocol used in Jabber) to deal with thousands of concurrent
              operations. For me, this is the most exciting announcement of RailsConf
              not because I do much with cloud computing but, because I want to, and this
              is just another piece of the puzzle. The whole process of XMPP providing
              presence -- like jabber instant messaging -- and running on an Erlang
              implementation of the jabber server that is hugely, horizontally scalable.
            </p>
            <p>
              It appears that you can use a jabber client or a command-line client to
              interact with the system. All sorts of things are capable. The examples
              Ezra gave included everything from requesting RAM and CPU statistics to
              rebuilding systems. Map/Reduce type scatter/gather dispatch for discovery
              and deployment is easily possible with the protocol in use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ezra coined a new acronym today, CREST, which stands for cloud REST. Along
              with this Ezra displayed an example that was built on Merb to show a Ruby
              interaction with the cloud using RESTful processes. Resources have URLs,
              just as they should.
            </p>
            <p>
              All in all, this process seems to be a platform that other cloud services
              could be built upon. I can't wait to dig right in considering he demoed the
              service running live.
