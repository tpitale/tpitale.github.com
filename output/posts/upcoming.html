              The short story is:
              <a href="http://www.viget.com">Viget</a>
              is being extremely generous and is paying for me to travel to
              <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home">RailsConf</a>
              this year. Despite the fact that I have only been in their employ for three
              whole weeks. I'm extremely happy working there and I only hope that I am
              living up to their expectations of me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am excited to go to RailsConf for two reasons. First, I have never been
              to a conference before, any conference, and I really expect to learn a lot
              in the sessions I am enrolled in. Second, I may finally get to meet many of
              the people I talk to on the irc chat rooms for Merb and DataMapper. People
              like Yehuda Katz, Ezra Z., Adam French (who I think is going), and a
              coworker from Viget South, Ben Scofield, who will be speaking, as well. All
              in all I have extremely high hopes for this trip.
            </p>

              In other news, I've got draft copies of many, many blog posts. The problem
              is trying to decide where they will be appropriate. Some are about the beta
              for
              <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
              (my favorite service, at the moment), including some nifty tricks. Another
              post is a followup to Getting Things Done with Mail and iCal combined with
              a review of the GTD application, Things. On the
              <a href="http://www.viget.com/extend/">Viget Extend blog</a>
              , I've got some ideas for posts on topics ranging from Microsoft Exchange
              calendar subscriptions in iCal to accessing the LDAP global address list
              from Address Book.
