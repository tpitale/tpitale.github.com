            <h1>Beta Testing the Slicehost API</h1>
            <h2>A Foray into ActiveResource and DNS Records</h2>
            <span class='date'>2008-03-21</span>
            <p>
              I was fortunate enough to join slicehost this past week. It is a fantastic
              service, possibly the best VPS I've encountered. While perusing their forum
              as I am want to do from time to time, I noticed a new post by a slicehost
              employee requesting beta-testers (a favorite phrase of mine) for their new
              API. I've used ActiveResource in the past and I thought it would be worth a
              shot.
            </p>
            <p>
              I threw in my hat on the forum and was summarily rewarded with an email
              from a slicehost employee. I was given an API key and some documentation
              with examples in Ruby and Python. Given my ActiveResource experience I
              immediately went to work with their example. It was a breeze and one that
              I am delighted to say any Rubyist would be able to complete.
            </p>
            <p>
              I completed the example, messed around a bit more, and then I retired for
              the evening. The next day I received a short questionnaire which I
              dutifully filled out and returned. My tinkering was not over, however. Oh,
              no. The next free chance I had, I dove right in. Given the access the beta
              provided I could create only two things off the top of my head. The first,
              a dynamic-dns-type updater. The second, a monitor of system status.
            </p>
            <p>
              So far, I have only completed the dynamic dns updater. It is crude but, it
              provides the basic functionality required. It allows you to provide a
              Zone and a Record, as well as, the IP address to use when updating the
              record. If you do not provide an IP address, the current external IP of
              your location will be used.
            </p>
            <p>
              The point of all this is I can have a domain name pointing to my home IP.
              If my provider changes my IP for whatever reason, the script, run by cron
              on a regular basis will tell slicehost, my DNS provider, that my home IP
              address has changed within a reasonable amount of time.
            </p>
