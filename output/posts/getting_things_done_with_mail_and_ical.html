            <h1>Getting Things Done</h1>
            <h2>With Apple Mail and iCal</h2>
            <span class='date'>2008-03-21</span>
            <p>
              I'm new to the practice of getting things done (GTD). I am aware of most
              of the principles and I am aware of the plethora of GTD software for Mac
              OS X. A number of weeks ago I took a brief survey of the available software
              in this particular field and, being a newcomer to the actual practice I
              felt sufficiently overwhelmed by the features of each. I do realize that
              GTD is about more than just a todo list but, for the ultra efficient all of
              these applications seemed to take more time to get set up, and to use than
              a simple checklist. Priorities are nice, as are due-dates but, beyond that
              I thought I would be better off with a simpler solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              So far, I am right. The metaphorical ticket, for me, was being constantly
              (or nearly constantly) aware of my list. Knowing this, and knowing that I
              live much of my life on my Mac I found the simplest solution I could
              manage: Mail and iCal. These two applications together provide the
              essentials that are required of a todo list. First, they make it easy to
              monitor your list. Second, they make it easy to access your list from two
              frequently accessed applications. Third, they make it exceptionally easy
              to add new items to my list.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've gotten in the habit of adding every little thing I could possibly
              accomplish in a day. I get to as much as I can. This accomplishes a couple
              goals. I get a big list of things to choose from and choice is always nice.
              It also provides that constant reminder for even the little things, many of
              which I would likely forget (or ignore) during the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps someday I will switch to some uber-GTD software but, for now, my
              requirements have been satisfied. I would recommend this process to anyone
              who is considering tackling the daunting GTD world.
