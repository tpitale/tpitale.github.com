            <h1>Making the New ICS Website</h1>
            <h2>Thanks to Webby, Haml, and Ruby</h2>
            <span class='date'>2009-01-12</span>
            <p>
              Last week I posted on the new ICS website I launched at
              <a href="http://winepos.com">winepos.com</a>
              which is built using the same little ruby gem as this site,
              <a href="http://github.com/TwP/webby/tree/master">Webby.</a>
              This week, I'd like to go into a little more detail on some of the things
              I did in creating their new site. Aside from what little design work I did
              (admittedly not my strongest ability) I will simply be covering many of the
              cool things you can do with Webby and a couple of tips and gotchas.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first step is obviously to create a new project. The webby-gen command
              should handle things nicely. I used the 'website' template because that was
              what I was building. From the basic project, I converted and modified all
              of the files created (layout, templates) to use Haml and to fit with a very
              basic structure that I was going to use.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the basic structure was in place, I created files for all of the site
              pages I was going to need. I also created directories for the feature pages
              and for the blog posts. At this point, I knew that I was going to be making
              lots of blog posts and so I created a new template for a blog page. A tip
              about templates, and pages in general: you can add any variables you would
              like to the header section of page, and later sort a search on it. Also,
              you can use Erb in a template and it will be interpreted when generating a
              new page from the template. For example, in order to get a solid created_at
              timestamp, I use Time.now.to_y inside an Erb tag.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I started to develop the site I discovered I was reusing pieces of
              content more and more frequently. In Rails/Merb it's trivial to create a
              partial snippet of content, and guess what, it's just as easy using Webby.
              The only thing to make a note of is that partials are looked for in the
              same path as a page being rendered. In order to share across different sub-
              directories you must add a preceding forward slash. For example, this:
              <code>
                render :partial => "/newsletter_form"
              </code>
              would search for a partial named '_newsletter_form.txt' in the root of the
              content folder. Also note that a different partial can be rendered by a
              layout calling partial from the different sub-directories. The default
              layout could call use partial 'footer' and both the blog and the feature
              folders could have that footer partial with different structure or content.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last thing I'll cover is making an atom feed from a set of pages. A
              similar technique can be used to make an xml sitemap for Google and other
              search engines. A feed is simply a page that has the extension set to xml
              and the markup content of which results in valid xml for the required
              specification. Be sure to set the layout to nil! As for the entries, I like
              to have all of my posts available in the feed, so I use the symbol :all to
              return all pages from find. For example:
              <code>
                @pages.find(:all, :in_directory => 'blog', :sort_by => 'created_at', :reverse => true)
              </code>
              The alternative would be to set a limit of some sort, like this:
              <code>
                @pages.find(:limit => 20, :in_directory => 'blog', :sort_by => 'created_at', :reverse => true)
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're looking to make a website that is going to be just HTML and you
              don't want to run a webserver aside from Apache or Nginx, Webby is probably
              the way to go. I certainly love it, and will continue to make static
              websites using it.
